+ I want to take a look at one particular book to give you an idea about what was involved in publishing illustrated books in the 1800s. The book calls The Birds of America, and the illustrator was James Audubon.
+ So the birds are of America... four vomumes which contained illustrations of nearly birds in tht United State, over the 400 birds all hand-colored, all painted life-sized, the large birds printed on the largest painting paper available at that time. This require a lot of dedication, and Audubon is best remembered as an incredibly meticulous, accurate artist, a very accomplished illustrator of the natural world. And while there were other artists working on similar projects at the same time. Audubon's book remains the most well-known and successful of its kind. But, let's talk a bit about the Audubon himself first.
+ First of all, Audubon was not a traditional painter. And by this, I mean he didn't that work in oils. He preferred to use watercolor and **pastel** **crayon**, and he worked on the paper instead of on **canvas**. The thing is the Audubon considered the illustration in his book not the original watercolor to be the finished product. His watercolor were merely preparatory studies, most of which were painted while he was observing birds in the wild. These watercolors were then sent to his printer, who created the final prints for the book. And the Audubon was so concerend with the accuracy that he often **scribbled** notes to the printer around the edges of these original watercolors.
+ In fact, you might question whether the producing a work of art was even the Audubon's goal. No, when I look at the Audubon illustration, I saw a work of art. But it may make more sense to consider Audubon first and foremost as a naturalist, as a science. See, the early 18th century, when Audubon was painting was a time of a major scientific inquiry. And an essential way of spreading scientific knowledege was through illustrated books.
+ So what did Audubon consider himself, an artist or a scientist.
+ I'm not sure the distinction between the two was all that clear in 1800s. I think we can accurately state that the driving force in his art was getting the science right. And this was perhaps a point that critics of his artwork at the time just didn't appreciate.
+ Audubon also studied the birds in ways that didn't dirctly inform his art. You know what bird banding is right? A bird has a band attched to its foot we can learn about things like migration patterns. The first we recorded instance of anyone doing that, it was Audubon. Another example, a common belief at the time was that **vultures** use their sense of smell to find food. Audubon didn't believe that, so he tested it. He put a large painting of a dead sheep in the field, and sure enough vultures found it and started pecking at it. Now Audubon's work was very accurate, and we know this because we can compare his illustration to the birds around us. But some times, it's not possible to check. They're actually several birds in his book that on one's ever seen. These are sometimes called Audubon's "mystery birds", because even though he drew them, there is no evidences that they exist in the wild. For someone who's respected as naturalist, isn't it strange to think that he drew some birds that don't appear to real?
+ For example, there is an illustration that appear to be a type of warbler, a small bird. it has a white ring around his eyes and white bars on its wings. No one's ever seen a warbler like this. So some people wonder if Aububon may be forgot certain details about this bird when he painted it. or that he copied another artist's work, but considering that Audubon was such a **meticulous** artist. Well, there might be a better answer.
+ Hibirdiztion is something that's well-know in birds. And definitely explains a rather unique -- looking duct Audubon painted. He himself suggested maybe it wasn't unkown species but a hibird, born from two different speices. Since then this paruicular crossing of species has acutally been recorded, both in the wild and in the captivity. So turns out that Audubons was right and this duct actually was a hibird.
