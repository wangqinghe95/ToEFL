# 从自身经验学习

## English
    I think it's more important to learn from personal experience, although advices from others are helpful and sometimes necessary.
    First of all, when you have problems or get into dilemma, you are person the who's familiar with what really want and it'll promote you to develop the ability to solve problems.
    Advices from others may be just the opposite to your expectations. In addition, more personal experience will make one more mature and capable.
    You can have a better understanding of a society in a more comprehensive and objective way.
    So I'd like to learn from personal experience.
