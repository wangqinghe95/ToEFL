## 以貌取人
    I don't think it is reliable to judge a person by the first glance. 
    Firstly, apperance doesn't represent all, the infomation of a person you can get from a glance is very limited. you can't tell many things just from the apperance, such as the past, hobbies, eating habits and so on.
    Furthmore, appearance lies, it may trick you. What you can get is partial, which even lead to prejudice. A person who dresess decently and talks sincerely  doesn't imlpy that he is definitely innocent and kind. You can't judge a book by its cover
    So I support that one shouldn't judge a person just from the appearance.
