# Government should support athletics
## content

1. 艺术和体育是与公民实际生活密切相关的两个重要组成部分。有些人可能会说，在有限的预算内，艺术应该首先被考虑，因为艺术在培养人们的审美。然后我认为，投入资金发展体育运动比发展艺术更重要,因为支持体育发展对大众和国家都有额外的好处。

1. Arts and athletics are essential parts related to citizen's actual lives. Some may argue that arts should be prioritized with limited budgets because it is crucial in developing people's aesthetics, However, I firmly believe that putting money into developing athletics in relatively more important than arts since there are more additional benefits for both of the common people and the nation in support of athletics.

2. 首先，支持体育发展对公民个人有很大好处。第一，帮助居民提高身体素质免受疾病困扰就是政府投入资金支持体育发展最大的好处。多运动能够增强国民的体质和免疫力，促进国民的身心健康，减少流行病和慢性病的患病风险。第二，体育运动可以提高居民生活的幸福感。参加体育锻炼不仅可以释放来自生活和工作的压力，培养它们乐观积极的心态同面对生活，还可以增强居民的自信心和自尊心，从而提高居民生活的幸福感。

2. To the begin with, There are more advantages for every individuals by supporting the development of athletics. Firstly, it is the biggest benfit that helping residents to improve their physical fitness from diseases for investing vast funds to make sports more properous. Do more exercise can enhance people's physical quality and immunity, and promote civilians's phycial and mental healthy, reduce the risk of contracting infulenza and chronic diseases. Secondly, Sports can raise happiness of life for inhabitants. Taking part in physical exercise can not only release stress from study and work, cultivate their positive and optimitic attitude to face life better, but also strenghten their confidence and self-esteem, so as to improve the residents' happiness life.

3. 其次，支持体育运动对社会有很多好处。第一，体育运动可以培养人们的团队协作能力。团队合作是体育运动的重要组成部分，通过参与体育运动，人们可以培养团队合作精神，帮助人们提高沟通协调能力。第二，体育运动可以促进社会和谐。在参加团体运动的过程中，人们相互帮助，团结一心，不仅能结交友谊，还能促进社会互动，从而增强公民的社会责任感和公民意识，有助于社会稳定。

3. In the next place, There are also many benfits for the whole of society to support sport. First, sport can develop people's teamwork ability. Collaboration is an improtant portion of sport, human can cultivate team work spirit and help people to improve their ability to communicate and coordinate by participate in activities. Secondly, it is able to promote social harmony as well. In the process of playing part in sports, it not only can make frineds, but also foster social interaction that people mutual help, and unity as one, thus strenghen the sense of social responsibility of the citizens and citizenship, as well as contribute to social stability.

4. 再次，支持体育发展对国家本身也有很多好处。第一，能够挑选出优秀的体育人才为国增光。通过在国内举办的各种各样的比赛，国家体育部门能够找到很多优秀的运动员去参加各种包括奥林匹克运动会这样的国际赛事，为国扬名，提高国民的自豪感和对国家的认同感。第二，支持体育发展能够发展经济。体育产业是一个巨大的产业链，如果政府支持体育运动的发展，将会带动整个产业链的发展，不仅能够解决大量就业问题，还能促进经济增长。比如举办赛事的门票和直播收入，国家运动员的代言等等。

4. Once more, it will be good for the country itself by putting more money in athletics. It is able to select more excellent talent to win honors for the nation. Through a wide variety of competitions held at home, National sport department can find enough elite athletes to take part in various international events like the Olympic Games to win the championship and become famous for the country that can enhance national pride and a sense of national identify. Besides, it will boost the development of economy better. The sport industry is a gaint industrial chain that will be drived better if suppotred by government. It not only is able to solve a large number of employment problems, but also promote economic development, Such as ticket and live broadcasts of hosting events, endoresements of national athletes and so on.

5. 最后，在一定程度上投入金钱在艺术很重要也很有必要，它能够提高公民的审美，能够陶冶人们的情操，帮助人们释放压力，但是这些优点都不能成为政府投入资金去发展艺术的主要原因，因为和艺术发展相比，体育更值得政府投入资金去发展。

5. In conclusion , it is necessary and significant to spend money on arts in some extent, which can increase people's aesthetic appreciation, uplift the mind and the spirit, release stress, however, none of these merits can be the major reason for the government to invest moneyto develop art. Because compared with arts, it is more worth for government to put more funds into the advancement of the sports.
