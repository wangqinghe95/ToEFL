# Government should support athletics

## Composition

Arts and athletics are essential parts related to citizen's actual lives. Some may argue that arts should be prioritized with limited budgets because it is crucial in developing people's aesthetics, However, I firmly believe that putting money into developing athletics in relatively more important than arts since there are more additional benefits for both of the common people and the nation in support of athletics.

To the begin with, There are more advantages for every individuals by supporting the development of athletics. Firstly, it is the biggest benefit that helping residents to improve their physical fitness from diseases for investing vast funds to make sports more properous. Do more exercise can enhance people's physical quality and immunity, and promote civilians's phycial and mental healthy, reduce the risk of contracting influenza and chronic diseases. Secondly, Sports can raise happiness of life for inhabitants. Taking part in physical exercise can not only release stress from study and work, cultivate their positive and optimitic attitude to face life better, but also strengthen their confidence and self-esteem, so as to improve the residents' happiness life.

In the next place, There are also many benefits for the whole of society to support sport. First, sport can develop people's teamwork ability. Collaboration is an improtant portion of sport, human can cultivate team work spirit and help people to improve their ability to communicate and coordinate by participate in activities. Secondly, it is able to promote social harmony as well. In the process of playing part in sports, it not only can make frineds, but also foster social interaction that people mutual help, and unity as one, thus strengthen the sense of social responsibility of the citizens and citizenship, as well as contribute to social stability.

Once more, it will be good for the country itself by putting more money in athletics. It is able to select more excellent talent to win honors for the nation. Through a wide variety of competitions held at home, National sport department can find enough elite athletes to take part in various international events like the Olympic Games to win the championship and become famous for the country that can enhance national pride and a sense of national identify. Besides, it will boost the development of economy better. The sport industry is a giant industrial chain that will be drived better if suppotred by government. It not only is able to solve a large number of employment problems, but also promote economic development, Such as ticket and live broadcasts of hosting events, endoresements of national athletes and so on.

In conclusion , it is necessary and significant to spend money on arts in some extent, which can increase people's aesthetic appreciation, uplift the mind and the spirit, release stress, however, none of these merits can be the major reason for the government to invest money to develop art. Because compared with arts, it is more worth for government to put more funds into the advancement of the sports.

艺术和体育是公民实际生活中必不可少的部分。有人认为，由于艺术对于培养人们的审美观至关重要，因此在预算有限的情况下应该优先考虑艺术。然而，我坚信，相对于艺术，将资金投入发展体育更为重要，因为支持体育运动对于普通民众和国家都有更多的附加益处。

首先，支持体育运动的发展对每个人都有更多的好处。首先，帮助居民通过投资巨额资金使体育运动更加繁荣，是帮助居民改善身体健康的最大好处。多做运动可以增强人们的身体素质和免疫力，促进民众的身体和心理健康，降低感染流感和慢性疾病的风险。其次，体育运动可以提高居民的生活幸福感。参加体育锻炼不仅可以释放学习和工作的压力，培养他们积极乐观的面对生活的态度，而且还可以增强他们的自信心和自尊心，从而提高居民的幸福生活。

其次，支持体育运动对整个社会也有很多好处。首先，体育运动可以培养人们的团队合作能力。合作是体育运动的重要组成部分，人类可以通过参加活动培养团队合作精神，帮助人们提高沟通和协调能力。其次，它也能促进社会和谐。在参加体育运动的过程中，不仅可以交朋友，而且可以培养人们互相帮助、团结一致的社交互动，从而增强公民和公民身份的社会责任感，促进社会稳定。

此外，将更多的资金投入体育运动对国家本身也有好处。它能够选择更多的优秀人才为国家赢得荣誉。通过在国内举办各种各样的比赛，国家体育部门可以找到足够的精英运动员参加各种国际赛事，如奥运会，赢得冠军并为国家赢得名声，从而增强民族自豪感和民族认同感。此外，它还能更好地推动经济的发展。体育产业是一个巨大的产业链，如果得到政府的支持，将会得到更好的发展。它不仅能够解决大量的就业问题，还能促进经济发展，例如举办活动的门票和现场直播，国家运动员的代言等。

总之，花费一定的资金在艺术上是必要而重要的，这可以增加人们的审美欣赏，提升心灵和精神，释放压力，但是，这些优点都不能成为政府投资发展艺术的主要原因。因为相比艺术，政府更值得将更多的资金投入体育运动的发展。
