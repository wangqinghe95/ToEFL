# Government should support athletics rather than arts
## Essay
Some people think that the government should spend more money on supporting arts, such as music, literature, painting, and film, than on supporting athletics, such as state-sponsored Olympic teams. They believe that the arts can enrich people’s cultural life, foster creativity and innovation, and enhance national identity and pride. However, I disagree with this view. In my opinion, the government should allocate more resources to athletics, because athletics can improve people’s physical and mental health, promote social cohesion and harmony, and stimulate economic growth and development.

One reason why I think the government should support athletics is that athletics can improve people’s physical and mental health. Participating in sports can help people stay fit, prevent diseases, and reduce stress. Moreover, watching sports can also bring joy, excitement, and inspiration to people. For example, many people enjoy watching the Olympic games and cheering for their favorite athletes and teams. The Olympic games can also inspire people to pursue their dreams and overcome their challenges.

Another reason why I think the government should support athletics is that athletics can promote social cohesion and harmony. Sports can bring people together, regardless of their backgrounds, cultures, or beliefs. Sports can also foster a sense of teamwork, cooperation, and fair play among people. Furthermore, sports can enhance the national pride and reputation of a country. For example, when a country wins a medal or a championship in an international competition, it can boost the morale and confidence of its people and gain the respect and recognition of other countries.

I admit that the arts also have some benefits for the country and its people. The arts can enrich people’s cultural life and provide them with various forms of entertainment and enjoyment. The arts can also foster creativity and innovation, which are essential for the development of science, technology, and economy. The arts can also enhance the national identity and pride, and promote cultural diversity and exchange. However, I think that these benefits are not as significant or urgent as the benefits of athletics. The arts can be supported by other sources, such as private donations, foundations, or corporations. The arts can also be appreciated and participated by people without the need of government intervention. Therefore, I think that the government should prioritize athletics over arts when allocating its limited resources.

In conclusion, I believe that the government should spend more money on supporting athletics than on supporting arts, because athletics can bring more benefits to the country and its people in terms of health, social, and economic aspects. Athletics can improve people’s physical and mental health, promote social cohesion and harmony, and stimulate economic growth and development. Therefore, the government should invest more in athletics and encourage more people to appreciate and participate in sports.

一些人认为政府应该花费更多的资金支持艺术，比如音乐，文学，绘画，电影，而不是支持体育运动，如国家资助的奥运代表队。他们认为艺术可以丰富人们的文化生活，培养创造力和创新，增强民族认同感和自豪感。但是我不同意这种观点。在我看来，政府应该分配更多的资源在体育运动上，因为体育运动可以改善人们身心健康，促进社会凝聚力与和谐，刺激经济增长和发展。

我认为政府应该支持体育运动的一个原因是体育运动可以改善人们的身心健康。参加体育运动能够帮助人们保持健康，预防疾病，减轻压力。而且观看体育运动能够给人们带来欢乐，兴奋，灵感。比如很多人喜欢观看奥林匹克运动会并且为他们喜欢的运动员和队伍加油。奥林匹克运动会也能激励人们去实现他们的梦想，克服自己的挑战。

我认为政府应该支持体育运动的另一个原因是体育运动能够促进社会凝聚力与和谐。运动能够忽略人们的背景，文化和信仰，把他们聚集在一起。运动能够培养人们之间的团队，合作和公平竞争的精神。此外，运动能够提高一个国家的民族自豪感和声誉。比如当一个国家在一个国际赛事中赢得金牌或者冠军时，它能够提高国民的士气和信心，获得其他国家的尊重和认可。

我承认艺术对于一个国家和它的国民有许多好处。艺术能够丰富国民的文化生活，为他们提供不同形式的娱乐方式和乐趣。艺术能够鼓励创造和创新，这对科学，技术，经济的发展至关重要。艺术还可以增加民族认同感和自豪感，促进文化多样性和交流。然而我认为这些好处并不像体育运动好处那样重要或者紧急。艺术能够由其他来源支持，比如个人捐赠，基金会或公司。艺术能够在没有政府的干预下被人们欣赏和参与。因此我认为政府应该在分配有限的资源时应该优先考虑体育运动而不是艺术。

总而言之，我认为政府应该投入更多的金钱去支持体育而不是艺术，因此体育能够在健康，社会，和经济方面给一个国家和它的国民带来更多的益处。体育运动能够促进人们的身心健康，提高社会凝聚力和和谐，刺激经济的增长和发展。因此政府应该加大体育投资，鼓励更多的人们支持并参加运动。
