# Government should support athletics rather than arts

## Essay
Some people think that the government should spend more money on supporting arts, such as music, literature, painting, and film, than on supporting athletics, such as state-sponsored Olympic teams. They believe that the arts can enrich people’s cultural life, foster creativity and innovation, and enhance national identity and pride. However, I disagree with this view. In my opinion, the government should allocate more resources to athletics, because athletics can improve people’s physical and mental health, promote social cohesion and harmony, and stimulate economic growth and development.

One reason why I think the government should support athletics is that athletics can improve people’s physical and mental health. Participating in sports can help people stay fit, prevent diseases, and reduce stress. Moreover, watching sports can also bring joy, excitement, and inspiration to people. For example, many people enjoy watching the Olympic games and cheering for their favorite athletes and teams. The Olympic games can also inspire people to pursue their dreams and overcome their challenges.

Another reason why I think the government should support athletics is that athletics can promote social cohesion and harmony. Sports can bring people together, regardless of their backgrounds, cultures, or beliefs. Sports can also foster a sense of teamwork, cooperation, and fair play among people. Furthermore, sports can enhance the national pride and reputation of a country. For example, when a country wins a medal or a championship in an international competition, it can boost the morale and confidence of its people and gain the respect and recognition of other countries.

I admit that the arts also have some benefits for the country and its people. The arts can enrich people’s cultural life and provide them with various forms of entertainment and enjoyment. The arts can also foster creativity and innovation, which are essential for the development of science, technology, and economy. The arts can also enhance the national identity and pride, and promote cultural diversity and exchange. However, I think that these benefits are not as significant or urgent as the benefits of athletics. The arts can be supported by other sources, such as private donations, foundations, or corporations. The arts can also be appreciated and participated by people without the need of government intervention. Therefore, I think that the government should prioritize athletics over arts when allocating its limited resources.

In conclusion, I believe that the government should spend more money on supporting athletics than on supporting arts, because athletics can bring more benefits to the country and its people in terms of health, social, and economic aspects. Athletics can improve people’s physical and mental health, promote social cohesion and harmony, and stimulate economic growth and development. Therefore, the government should invest more in athletics and encourage more people to appreciate and participate in sports.
