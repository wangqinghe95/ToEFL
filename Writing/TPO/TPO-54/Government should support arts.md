# Government should support arts rather than athletics

## Essay
Some people think that the government should spend more money on supporting athletics, such as state-sponsored Olympic teams, than on supporting arts. They believe that athletics can bring more benefits to the country, such as improving physical health, promoting social harmony, and boosting economic development. However, I disagree with this view. In my opinion, the government should allocate more resources to the arts, because the arts can enrich people's cultural life, foster creativity and innovation, and enhance national identity and pride.

First of all, the arts can enrich people's cultural life and provide them with various forms of entertainment and enjoyment. The arts include music, literature, painting, sculpture, theater, film, and many other forms of expression. They can appeal to different tastes and preferences of people and offer them a way to relax, escape, or reflect on their life experiences. The arts can also stimulate people's emotions and imagination and help them cope with stress and challenges. For example, listening to music can soothe one's mood, reading a novel can transport one to another world, and watching a movie can inspire one to pursue one's dreams. Therefore, the government should support the arts and make them more accessible and affordable to the public.

Secondly, the arts can foster creativity and innovation, which are essential for the development of science, technology, and economy. The arts can encourage people to think critically, creatively, and independently, and to explore new possibilities and solutions. The arts can also inspire people to discover new knowledge, invent new products, and create new industries. For example, many scientific discoveries and inventions were influenced by the arts, such as the theory of relativity by Einstein, who was a violinist, and the Apple products by Steve Jobs, who was a calligrapher. Therefore, the government should support the arts and cultivate a culture of creativity and innovation.

Thirdly, the arts can enhance national identity and pride, and promote cultural diversity and exchange. The arts can reflect the history, values, and traditions of a country and its people, and help them preserve and celebrate their cultural heritage. The arts can also showcase the uniqueness and richness of a country's culture to the world, and attract more tourists, investors, and partners. The arts can also facilitate cross-cultural communication and understanding, and foster mutual respect and cooperation among different countries and regions. For example, the Chinese opera, the Indian Bollywood, and the French impressionism are all examples of distinctive and influential artistic expressions that represent their respective cultures and contribute to the global cultural landscape. Therefore, the government should support the arts and enhance the country's cultural influence and reputation.

In conclusion, I believe that the government should spend more money on supporting the arts than on supporting athletics, because the arts can bring more benefits to the country and its people in terms of cultural, intellectual, and economic aspects. The arts can enrich people's cultural life, foster creativity and innovation, and enhance national identity and pride. Therefore, the government should invest more in the arts and encourage more people to appreciate and participate in the arts.
