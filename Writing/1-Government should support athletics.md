# Government should support athletics

+ I firmly believe that putting money into developing athletics is relatively more important than arts since there are more additional benefits for both the common people and the nation in support of athletics. Arts and athletics are essential parts related to citizens' actual lives. Some may argue that arts should be prioritized with limited budgets because it is crucial in developing people's aesthetics. However, I believe that arts, although important in developing people's aesthetics, should take a lower priority compared to athletics due to the additional benefits they bring to both individuals and the nation.

+ To begin with, supporting the development of athletics offers numerous advantages for individuals. Firstly, investing vast funds to make sports more prosperous has the biggest benefit of improving residents' physical fitness and reducing the risk of diseases. Regular exercise enhances physical quality, promotes mental and physical health, and boosts immunity, thereby reducing the likelihood of contracting chronic diseases and influenza. Secondly, participating in physical exercise brings happiness to individuals' lives. Apart from alleviating stress and cultivating a positive and optimistic attitude towards life, it strengthens confidence and self-esteem, ultimately leading to a happier life.

+ In addition, supporting sports also yields various benefits for society as a whole. First, sports help develop individuals' teamwork abilities. Cooperation is a fundamental aspect of sports, offering opportunities for participants to cultivate teamwork and enhance communication and coordination skills. Second, sports contribute to social harmony by fostering mutual help, unity, and social interaction among individuals. This, in turn, strengthens citizens' sense of social responsibility and citizenship while promoting social stability. 

+ Furthermore, investing in athletics benefits the country itself in multiple ways. Firstly, it enables the discovery and nurturing of exceptional talent, leading to national honors and enhancing national pride and identity. By organizing various domestic competitions, the National Sports Department can identify elite athletes to represent the country in international events such as the Olympic Games and bring home championships.

+ Additionally, financial support for athletics promotes economic development. The sports industry, with its large-scale industrial chain, has the potential to solve employment problems and contribute to economic growth. Hosting events, ticket sales, live broadcasts, and national athletes' endorsements are among the economic opportunities that arise from investing in sports.

+ In conclusion, while spending money on the arts can have some merits such as enhancing aesthetic appreciation and relieving stress, these are not sufficient grounds for the government to prioritize investment in arts over sports. The advantages offered by supporting sports, such as improving physical fitness, promoting happiness in individuals' lives, developing teamwork abilities, fostering social harmony, discovering exceptional talent, and boosting economic development, make it more worthwhile for the government to allocate additional funds towards the advancement of athletics.
