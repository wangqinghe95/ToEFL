# Government should support athletics

## Article
+ I firmly believe that putting money into developing athletics is relatively more important than arts since there are more additional benefits for both the common people and the nation in support of athletics. Arts and athletics are essential parts related to citizens' actual lives. Some may argue that arts should be prioritized with limited budgets because it is crucial in developing people's aesthetics. However, I believe that arts, although important in developing people's aesthetics, should take a lower priority compared to athletics due to the additional benefits they bring to both individuals and the nation.

+ To begin with, supporting the development of athletics offers numerous advantages for individuals. Firstly, investing vast funds to make sports more prosperous has the biggest benefit of improving residents' physical fitness and reducing the risk of diseases. Regular exercise enhances physical quality, promotes mental and physical health, and boosts immunity, thereby reducing the likelihood of contracting chronic diseases and influenza. Secondly, participating in physical exercise brings happiness to individuals' lives. Apart from alleviating stress and cultivating a positive and optimistic attitude towards life, it strengthens confidence and self-esteem, ultimately leading to a happier life.

+ In addition, supporting sports also yields various benefits for society as a whole. First, sports help develop individuals' teamwork abilities. Cooperation is a fundamental aspect of sports, offering opportunities for participants to cultivate teamwork and enhance communication and coordination skills. Second, sports contribute to social harmony by fostering mutual help, unity, and social interaction among individuals. This, in turn, strengthens citizens' sense of social responsibility and citizenship while promoting social stability. 

+ Furthermore, investing in athletics benefits the country itself in multiple ways. Firstly, it enables the discovery and nurturing of exceptional talent, leading to national honors and enhancing national pride and identity. By organizing various domestic competitions, the National Sports Department can identify elite athletes to represent the country in international events such as the Olympic Games and bring home championships.

+ Additionally, financial support for athletics promotes economic development. The sports industry, with its large-scale industrial chain, has the potential to solve employment problems and contribute to economic growth. Hosting events, ticket sales, live broadcasts, and national athletes' endorsements are among the economic opportunities that arise from investing in sports.

+ In conclusion, while spending money on the arts can have some merits such as enhancing aesthetic appreciation and relieving stress, these are not sufficient grounds for the government to prioritize investment in arts over sports. The advantages offered by supporting sports, such as improving physical fitness, promoting happiness in individuals' lives, developing teamwork abilities, fostering social harmony, discovering exceptional talent, and boosting economic development, make it more worthwhile for the government to allocate additional funds towards the advancement of athletics.

+ 我坚信，将资金投入到体育运动的发展上比艺术更重要，因为支持体育运动能给普通民众和国家带来更多的额外好处。艺术和体育运动都是与公民实际生活密切相关的重要部分。有些人可能会认为，由于艺术对于培养人们的审美能力至关重要，所以在预算有限的情况下应该优先考虑艺术。然而，我认为，艺术虽然对于培养人们的审美能力很重要，但由于体育运动能给个人和国家带来更多的额外好处，所以相比之下应该降低其优先级。

+ 首先，支持体育运动的发展为个人带来了许多好处。首先，投入大量资金使体育运动更加繁荣，最大的好处是提高居民的身体素质，降低患病的风险。经常锻炼可以增强身体素质，促进身心健康，提高免疫力，从而降低患慢性病和流感的可能性。其次，参与体育锻炼也能给个人的生活带来快乐。除了缓解压力，培养积极乐观的生活态度外，还能增强自信和自尊心，最终导致更幸福的生活。

+ 此外，支持体育运动也为整个社会带来了各种好处。首先，体育运动有助于培养个人的团队合作能力。合作是体育运动的一个基本方面，为参与者提供了培养团队合作、提高沟通协调能力的机会。其次，体育运动通过促进个人之间的互助、团结和社会

+ 此外，投资体育运动还能以多种方式惠及国家本身。首先，它能够发现和培养杰出的人才，为国家赢得荣誉，增强国家的自豪感和认同感。通过组织各种国内比赛，国家体育部门可以选拔出优秀的运动员，代表国家参加奥运会等国际赛事，并带回冠军。

+ 此外，对体育运动的财政支持也促进了经济发展。体育产业，凭借其庞大的产业链，有潜力解决就业问题，促进经济增长。举办赛事、售票、直播以及国家运动员的代言等都是投资体育运动所带来的经济机会。

+ 总之，虽然在艺术上花钱可以有一些好处，比如提高审美能力和缓解压力，但这些并不足以成为政府优先投资艺术而不是体育的理由。支持体育运动所带来的好处，比如提高身体素质、促进个人生活的幸福、培养团队合作能力、促进社会和谐、发现杰出人才和推动经济发展等，使得政府将更多的资金分配到体育运动的发展上更有价值。
