## 翻译：
+ 首先，过度看电视会给孩子的健康带来负面影响。
+ 一方面，由于缺乏自控力，他们可能会沉迷于电视节目，比如卡通片。长时间的看着屏幕会损害他们的视力，这样的话他们就不能清楚的看到黑板上的单词了。而且，长时间久坐，孩子们会肥胖和容易得到其他疾病，这样会导致在学校有不好的表现。另一方面，很明显，孩子们不成熟所以他们不能明辨是非。因此他们很容易受到电视节目里负面情绪的影响，像暴力和色情内容，从而形成错误的价值观。当和其他同龄人有矛盾时，孩子们会和他们打架。而且如果孩子花费太多的时间在虚拟世界里，他们会变得孤僻，失去正常方式的社交能力，这样会影响他们和那些能在学习上给予帮助的朋友的关系。
+ 所以，我们有理由相信限制孩子看电视的时间会对他们的健康有帮助。
+ 此外，沉迷于电视节目导致孩子们学习效率的降低。
+ 第一，在当今时代，孩子们有太多的学科去学习，并且他们也有大量的家庭作业需要完成。所以孩子们需要有足够的时间去预习复习课本，并且完成他们的家庭作业。如果孩子们把时间都花费在电视节目上，他们就不能去巩固他们学到的知识。其次，因为孩子缺乏自制力，如果他们熬夜看电视，那么他们第二天在课堂上就会很困，而且他们也很可能在课堂上想着各种电视节目，这样就导致无法集中精神去听讲，最后就不能完全的掌握课堂上老师传授的知识，严重影响孩子们的学习效率。
+ 所以，有足够多的证据证明限制孩子们看电视的时间会帮助孩子们提高学习效率。
