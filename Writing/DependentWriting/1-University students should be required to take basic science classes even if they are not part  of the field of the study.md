# University students should be required to take basic science classes even if they are not part of the field of the study

1. 我认为大学生应该去上一些基础的科学课程，尽管他们以后可能不会从事该行业领域的研究。
2. 首先基础的科学课程有帮助人们更好的了解这个世界。物理知识可以让人们更好的理解一些生活常识，化学知识可以帮助人们探索物质的微观结构和宏观性质，地理知识可以帮助人们扩展眼界。大学生，作为接受高等教育的群体，更应该了解一些基础的科学知识，培养正确的世界观。
3. 再次，学习基础科学知识能够提高大学生的创新能力和解决问题的能力。系统地学习基础科学知识的过程，也是一个不断提出问题，复现问题，解决问题，回答问题的过程。在这个过程中，通过不停地进行科学实验，不仅能够培养研究者的科学素养和思维，即用科学的手段和方法去思考问题，而且还能让研究者了解如何使用科学去解决问题，从而帮助提高他们的创新能力。
4. 然后，了解基础科学知识也有助于大学生在他们在本专业领域学习。通过接触不同的学科领域和前沿问题，可以拓展他们的知识面和视野，激发他们对科学的兴趣和好奇心。除此之外，在这期间积累的经验和培养的能力可以贯穿他们整个人生，这些不仅能让他们本专业的的学习中表现得更优异，甚至他们未来的学习和职业生涯中也能因此收益。
5. 开设基础科学课程也能给大学生提供更多的选择和机会。不是所有的大学生在进入大学之前就已经对自己人生有了清晰的规划，开设基础科学课程让他们尽可能地多了解一下社会和科研，就有可能就能帮助一些人打开新的世界，帮助大学生从事自己感兴趣的领域，这样还能为科学研究领域增加一份新的力量。
6. 综上，要求大学生参加基础科学课程不仅对于大学生大学专业学习有好处，而且未来的生活和工作都能从中收益，因此这项措施值得鼓励且推进。

# Composition
I think it is advisable for all college students to take some basic science classes, because these are a handful of benefits for them although they might not be work in these fields in the future.
Firstly, these basic science classes is so important that to help people to know about this world better. Physical knowledge can be able to make people understand common sense of life and live a happier life, learning chemistry can contribute to expolre the composition of substance, and geography can tell us what the earyh is like. University students, as a group of higher education, are supposed to know more about the basic scientific knowledge, and develop a correct conception of world.
Secondly, taking basic science classes can enable improve the ability of solving problem and innovation for students. The process of studying scientific knowledge in a systematic way is also a process of constantly raising question, reproducing question and solving them, in which it would be able to not only cultivate researcher's scientific literacy and thinking, that is, to use scientific means and methods to think about problems, but also help them know how to solve the difficilties with scientific way, so as to improve their ability of innovation.
Afterwards, Knowing about basic scientific knowledge contribute to college students to study in their professional field. Because it can expand their scope of knowledge and horizons through exposure to different subject area and frontier issues, stimulate their interest and curiority in the field of science. Besides, the gained harvest and acquired expeiences can plan an important role in their lives, which can make them perform even better in their major classes, and be advantage for their learning career in the future as well as professional carrer.
Finally, there will be alsp more options and choices for students to choose from if setting up basic science classes. Not everyone have a clear plan for their future before they enter college. Open some science classes to make them know about the research and society as much as impossibile, which probably will be helpful for someone to open up a new world, and choose the industry that they are interested in. This will also add new forces to the filed of scientific research.
In conclusion, there are more advantages for requiring university students to take basic science classes that would be good for their majors, but also benefit from their future life and work, so it is advisable to encourage and promote this measures.

## Review

I think it is advisable for all college students to take some basic science classes, because although they might not work in these fields in the future, there are a handful of benefits for them. 

Firstly, taking basic science classes can help people to know about this world better. Physical knowledge can make people understand the common sense of life and live a happier life. Learning chemistry can contribute to the exploration of the composition of substances, and geography can provide information about the Earth. As a group of higher education, university students are supposed to learn more about basic scientific knowledge and develop a correct conception of the world. 

Secondly, basic science classes can improve students' problem-solving and innovation abilities. The process of studying scientific knowledge in a systematic way involves raising questions, reproducing questions, and solving them. This not only cultivates researchers' scientific literacy and thinking, but also helps them know how to solve difficulties using a scientific approach, thus improving their innovation ability. 

Furthermore, knowing basic scientific knowledge contributes to college students' studies in their professional fields. It expands their scope of knowledge and horizons through exposure to different subject areas and frontier issues, stimulating their interest and curiosity in the field of science. The acquired knowledge and experiences play an important role in their lives, making them perform better in their major classes and benefiting them in their future learning and professional careers.

Finally, setting up basic science classes provides more options and choices for students. Not everyone has a clear plan for their future before entering college. By opening some science classes, students can learn about research and society, which can help them open up new possibilities and choose industries that they are interested in. This also adds new forces to the field of scientific research. 

In conclusion, requiring university students to take basic science classes has more advantages that not only benefit their majors but also their future life and work. Therefore, it is advisable to encourage and promote this measure.

## review translation
我认为，对于所有的大学生来说，参加一些基础科学课程是明智的，因为即使他们将来不从事这些领域，也有很多好处。

首先，参加基础科学课程可以帮助人们更好地了解这个世界。物理知识可以让人们理解生活的常识，过上更幸福的生活。学习化学可以有助于探索物质的组成，而地理学可以提供关于地球的信息。作为高等教育的一部分，大学生应该学习更多的基础科学知识，并形成正确的世界观。

其次，基础科学课程可以提高学生的问题解决和创新能力。系统地学习科学知识的过程涉及提出问题、复制问题和解决问题。这不仅培养了研究人员的科学素养和思维，还帮助他们知道如何使用科学方法解决困难，从而提高了他们的创新能力。

此外，了解基础科学知识有助于大学生在专业领域的学习。通过接触不同的学科领域和前沿问题，它扩展了他们的知识范围和视野，激发了他们对科学领域的兴趣和好奇心。所获得的知识和经验在他们的生活中起着重要作用，使他们在主修课程中表现更好，并使他们在未来的学习和职业生涯中受益。

最后，设置基础科学课程为学生提供了更多的选择和机会。并不是每个人在进入大学之前都有明确的未来计划。通过开设一些科学课程，学生可以了解研究和社会，这有助于他们开拓新的可能性并选择他们感兴趣的行业。这也为科学研究领域增添了新的力量。

总之，要求大学生参加基础科学课程具有更多的优点，不仅有利于他们的专业，还有利于他们未来的生活和工作。因此，鼓励和推广这一措施是明智的。
