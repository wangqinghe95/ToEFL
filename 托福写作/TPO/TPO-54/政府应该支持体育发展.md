# 政府应该支持体育发展

## 行文
### 中文：
1. 艺术和体育是与公民实际生活密切相关的两个重要组成部分。有些人可能会说，在有限的预算内，艺术应该首先被考虑，因为艺术在培养人们的审美。然后我认为，投入资金发展体育运动比发展艺术更重要。
2. 毫无疑问的是艺术对市民，社会都是非常重要的，首先艺术可以陶冶人们的情操，丰富公民的精神生活，改善社会的风气面貌。但是艺术的发展需要耗费更多的金钱和精力，并且很多家庭没有足够的经济去支持孩子去学习艺术，这也就意味着艺术的受众有限。最后身体健康也是学习艺术的前提。
3. 相较于培养艺术，投入金钱在培养居民的体育运动方面，好处会更多。首先，一个好的身体是做任何事情的前提，身体素质的提高可以支持人们更好的工作生活学习，对于艺术的培养也有促进作用，其次身体素质的改善，也更有助于精神面貌的改善，可以培养国民的自信心。最后全民的身体素质的提高，减少去治疗的频率，也有助于国家在医疗上面的补贴，可以节省更多的资源去发展其他领域，比如艺术等。
4. 所以政府应该在体育运动方面投入更多的金钱去帮助提高居民的身体素质。

### Context
1. Arts and athletics are two essential parts related to citizen's actual lives. Some may argue that with limited budgets, arts should be prioritized because they are crucial in developing people's aesthetics. However, I firmly believe putting money into developing athletics in relatively important than arts.
2. There is no doubt that arts are significant for both residents, and even the whole society, since it can cultivate people's sentiment, enrich citizen's spiritual life, and improve social atmosphere. Nevertheless, the development of the whole arts will spend more financing of the government than athletics. Furthermore, a host of family have no enough economy base to support their children to learn art, so not many people benefit directly from investing money to develop the art, and it will spend several generations to take effect if we want to improve people’s aesthetic appreciation. Finally, prerequisite of learning art is also to have a good body.
3. Compared to supporting the development of art, there are more advantages to support athletics. firstly, it can improve the physical fitness of the residents and the enhancement of the physical body can support people to better work, study and life, including the cultivation of national art. Secondly, the growth of the physical quality for all residents in the country also can discover more sport's talents to win more trophies in various international sports competitions, and these achievements also can help people to build more confidence. Last but not least, the improvement of the whole citizen's physical body can reduce the frequency to go to the hospital, which can also reduce the national investment in medical care, and help country to save more resources to put into other fields, such as art.
4. So, it is advisable for government to help people to improve their physical body by putting more money in athletics.
