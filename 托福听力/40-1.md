+ Thanks for seeing me, Professor Jaskson.
+ Sure, Tom. what can I do for you.
+ I'm gonna do my term project on service design, What you see as a customer, the physical layout of the building, the parking lot.
+ And I thought I'd focus on various kinds of a eateries...restaurants, coffee shops, cafeterias, so I'd also analyze where you order your food, where you eat, and so on.
+ Well, I thought you were going to come up with a hypothetical business plan for an amusement park? Isn't that what you e-mail me last week? I couldn't sworn... oh, I'm thinking of a Tom from another class, Tom Benson. Sorry, sorry
+ No problem, I did e-mail you my idea too, though.
+ That's right, I remember now. Resturants, yeah.
+ So, here is my question, I read something about service standard that kinda confused me. What difference between service design and service standard?
+ Service standard refers to what a company...employees are idealy supported to do in order for everything to operate smoothly. The protocols to be followed.
