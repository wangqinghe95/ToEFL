## Do you agree or disagree	that holding different opinions	will hurt friendship?
+ 我不同意持有不同观点会伤害友情这一看法。
+ 首先，每个人的背景，文化，成长环境各不相同，所以每个人看问题的角度和方式也是不一样的。两个人对于一件事的持有不同观点是一个非常正常的事情，所以我们应该理解包容这种差异和不同。
+ 再次，不同的观点可以促进更深入的讨论和理解，帮助我们看到问题的不同方面。通过对不同观点的交流，可以让友谊变得更加丰富和有意义，也可以增加朋友之间对彼此的理解和接纳。

+ I disagree with the view that holding different opinions will hurt friendship.
+ First, everyone's background, culture and growing environment are different, which leads to everyone having a different perspective and approach to issues. so it's very common for two people to hold different views on the same thing, we should appreciate and understand this difference.
+ Secondly, different perspectives can promote deeper discussions and understanding, helping us see different aspects of a problem. Through the exchange of different views, friendship can become more enriching and meaningful, and it can also increase the understanding and acceptance between friends.

## Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should	not interrupt others when they are giving opinions.
+ 我同意这个观点。
+ 首先，打断别人说话本身就是一件很不礼貌的事情。这会让人感觉到他们的观点不被尊重或者不被重视，除非是在一些紧急的情况下或者需要纠正别的人错误的时候。尊重他人的发言是良好沟通的基础。
+ 再次，打断别人表达观点会影响沟通交流的效率。当一个人正在投入时间和精力去思考和表达他们的想法时，打断他们可能会打乱他们的思考过程，是他们无法完整地表达他们地观点，降低了沟通交流的效率。

+ I agree with this view.
+ first of all, it is very impolite to interrupt others when they are giving opinions, which will make one feel that their views are not respected or valued, unless in some emergency or when correcting someone who is wrong. Respect for what others say is the foundation for good communication.
+ Secondly, interrupting others while they are expressing their views can affect the efficiency of communication. When a person is investing time and energy to think and express their ideas, interrupting them may disrupt their thought process, preventing them from fully expressing their views, and reducing the efficiency of communication.

## Some	secondary school require that every student’s schedule include study hall, which is a free class period during the school day in which students can	do class assignments or rest. do you think this is a good idea? why or why not? use details and examples in your response.
+ 我认为这是一个好的主意。
+ 首先，可以培养独立学习的能力，提供一个空闲的教室鼓励学生进行自主学习。这样的环境可以让学生在没有老师的指导下，自己独立的解决问题，这对于培养他们的独立思考的能力非常有帮助。
+ 再次，这样的空间也可以作为同学们的社交空间，让他们有机会在可与时间与同学交流，分享学习经验，甚至进行小组讨论，不仅能够增强他们的团队协作能力，还有助于建立良好的人际关系，对他们的社会技能的发展也很重要。

+ I think this is a good idea.
+ Firstly, it can cultivate the ability to learn independently. Providing a free classroom encourages students to learn autonomously. Such an environment allows students to solve problems independently without the guidance of a teacher, which is very helpful for cultivating their independent thinking ability.
+ Secondly, such a space can also serve as a social space for classmates, giving them the opportunity to communicate with classmates during free time, share learning experiences, and even conduct group discussions. This not only enhances their team collaboration skills, but also helps to establish good interpersonal relationships, which is also important for the development of their social skills.

## Some	university require students	to choose a	major when entering school while others	require students to study several fields at first and then choose a	major. Which do you prefer?

+ 我认为大学生应该先学习多个领域，再选择一个专业。
+ 首先，大学生在选择专业之前先学习多个领域，可以帮助他们更全面地了解自己的兴趣和潜力，这样就可以在他们选择专业的时候做出更明智的决定，也是对他们未来的生活和职业负责。
+ 再次，这可以培养大学生的创新思维。跨领域的学习可以帮助学生看到不同领域之间的联系，通过学习和比较不同领域的知识，从而产生新的想法和解决方案。

+ I believe that university students should study multiple fields before choosing a major.
+ Firstly, university students studying multiple fields before choosing a major can help them understand their interests and potential more comprehensively. This can enable them to make wiser decisions when choosing their major, which is responsible for their future life and career.
+ Secondly, this can cultivate the innovative thinking of university students. Cross-disciplinary learning can help students see the connections between different fields. By learning and comparing knowledge from different fields, they can generate new ideas and solutions.

## Do you agree or disagree? Parents can know their children’s grades only when they get permission by their children?

+ 我不同意父母需要在得到他们孩子的许可下才能知道孩子的成绩这个观点。
+ 首先，父母作为孩子的监护人，有权利关心孩子的成长，也有权利查看孩子的成绩。只有了解孩子的学习成绩，父母才能更好的指导和督促孩子的学习。
+ 当然，这不意味着父母可以过度干预孩子的学习和生活，需要父母把握好亲子关系的界限，既能尊重孩子的独立性又能更好地帮助孩子地成长。

+ I disagree with this view.
+ first, as the guardians of their children, parents have the right to understand the growth of their children, and also have the right to check the grades of their children. Parents can guide and supervise their children's learning only by knowing their children's academic performance.
+ Of course, this doesn't mean that parents can excessively intervene in their children's lives and studies. Parents need to grasp the boundaries of parent-child relationship, which can not only repsect children's independence but also help children grow up better.

## Do you agree	or disagree with the following statement? Kids should be allowed to keep pets.
+ I agree with this view. 
+ First, there are many benefits for children in keeping pets, which can help them cultivate warmth of heart, patience and responsibility, can accompany their growth, and help them how to take care of and respect life, etc.
+ Second, there are some precondition to allow children to keep pets, for example, it needs good economic foundation, and there should be enough time and energy to look after pets. If the family condition allows, it is a good thing to keep a pet.

+ 我同意这个观点
+ 首先，养宠物对孩子有很多好处，可以帮助孩子培养爱心，耐心和责任感，可以陪伴孩子成长，帮助孩子学习如何照顾和尊重生命等等。
+ 但是允许孩子养宠物有一些前置条件，比如需要一定的经济基础，有足够的时间和精力来照顾宠物等等，如果在家庭条件满足的情况下，允许孩子养宠物是一个好事。

## A/D: We should be completely honest and open with friends 
+ I agree with this view.
+ Firstly, it's a necessary condition to be honest with friends. We can only gain true friendship from our friends if we are honest. So, it’s important to be honest with friends
+ Secondly, it’s also essential for friends to be open-minded. Open-mindedness is the ability to allow friends to hold different opinions. Because everyone’s background, culture, and beliefs are different, we need to find common ground and respect differences with our friends.

+ 我同意这个观点。
+ 首先，对朋友保持真诚是建立友谊的必要条件。只有真诚的与朋友交往，我们才能从朋友那里获得真正的友谊。所以很有必要与朋友保持真诚。
+ 再次，开放对于友谊也非常重要，开放指的是允许和朋友持有不同的观点，因为每个人的背景，文化，信仰不同，所以我们要和朋友们求同存异。
