# Practice 2016-2018

## Some people buy food that is already prepared. Other people buy fresh food and prepare meals themselves. Which do you prefer?(2016-01-09)(need to write again)
+ 我更喜欢买已经做好的食物。
+ 第一个原因是这可以帮助我节省很多时间，我可以做一下我感兴趣的有趣的事，比如游泳，骑行或者阅读，这些有益于我的身心健康。
+ 第二个原因是有很多种食物供我选择，如果我在外面吃，我认为这会比我自己做的食物更美味，因为它们都是由很多年厨艺经验的人做的。

+ I prefer buying food that is already prepared. 
+ The first reason is that it will help me save plenty of time so that I can do some interesting things I enjoy, such as swimming, riding and reading, which are beneficial for my mental and physical health. 
+ The second reason is that there are various types of foods that I can choose from. If I eat outside, I think it will be more delicious than the food I cook by myself, because they are made by the people who have many years of cooking.

##  Do you agree that celebrities are good examples for young people? 
+ 我不同意名人是年轻人很好的榜样这一观点。
+ 第一个原因是名人只是被很多人知道，但是名人并不一定由其他好的品质，比如正直，远见或者能力。
+ 第二个原因是我认为那些为社会和国家做过贡献的人才有资格成为年轻人好的榜样，比如科学家，优秀的老师，和伟大的政治家，因为他们做的事非常有意义，也值得年轻人学习。

+ I disagree with the view that **celebrities** are good examples for young people.
+ The first reason is that celebrities are just known to a lot of people, but celebrities don't necessarily have other good characteristics, such as integrity, vision or competence.
+ The second reason is that I think the people who contribute to the society and country qualified to be good examples for young children, such as scientists, **excellent** teachers, and great politicians, because what they do is very meaningful and worth learning for young children.

## Some people prefer to make a plan with their friends about social activities, while others prefer to decide about what to do when they meet their friends. Which do you prefer?
+ 我喜欢和我的朋友制定关于社会活动的计划。
+ 第一个原因是这可以节省所有参与者的时间，制定一个好的计划可以告诉所有人我们需要做什么， 什么时间什么地点去做。尽管所有的社会活动可能不会如计划那样进行，至少我们知道我们的目标是什么，我们应该做什么。
+ 第二个原因是如果我们提前做了计划，我们可以为社会活动提前准备些什么，比如携带一些必要的设备，穿上合适的衣服和鞋子。这样社会活动可能会更成功。

+ I would like to make a plan with my friends about social acitivities.
+ The first reason is that it can save time for all participants. Making a good plan can tell everyone what we need to do, when and where to do it. Although the social activities may not proceed exactly as planned, at least we know what our goal is and what we should do.
+ The second reason is that we can prepare something for social activities if we make a plan in advance, such as taking some necessary equipment, wearing proper clothes and shoes. That way the social activities would be even more successful.

## Do you agree that universities are successful because of experienced professors?
+ 我不同意大学因为有经验的教授而成功。
+ 第一个原因是我认为大学是一个教书的地方，所以大学的成功取决于是否能够培育优秀的大学生，他们有正直和能力。
+ 第二个原因是有很多因素影响培养有道德和能力的大学生，比如大学的校风，老师的品德。所以只有经验丰富的教授是不够的。

+ I disagree with the view that universities are successful because of experienced professors.
+ The first reason is that I think the university is a place for teaching, so the success of a univeristy depends on whether it is able to teach excellent college students who both have integrity and competence.
+ The second reason is that there are many factors that affect the cultivation of moral character and ability of college students, such as school spirit of the university and the quality of teachers. So it's not enough to only have experienced professors.

## Which is more important to the success of an artist: natural talent or hard work?
+ 我认为对一个艺术家的成功来说，天赋要比努力更重要。
+ 第一个原因是，天赋是一个人的上限，特别是对于一个艺术家。天赋高的人更有可能想出好的想法，或者从他生活中或者想象力中获得灵感，因此对于他们来说更容易创造出非凡的艺术品。
+ 第二个原因是天赋能够培养出创造力，这些对于艺术家想要成功非常重要，比如它们能够帮助他们在艺术领域达到更大的高度。

+ I think the natural talent is more important than hard work to the success of an artist.
+ The first reason is that natural talent sets the upper limit for a person, especially for an artist. People who are born with high talent are more likely to come up with good ideas, or draw inspiration from things in their life or imagination, Therefore it is easier for them to create extraordinary works of art.
+ The second reason is that talent can foster creativity and innovation, These are essential qualities for artists to be successful, as they can help them achieve greater heights in the field of art.

## Do you agree that schools should encourage students to be creative and imaginative in order for them to be successful?
+ 我同意为了学生更加的成功，学校应该鼓励学生更有创造力和想象力这一观点。
+ 第一个原因是这可以帮助学生应对学术的要求和挑战，学生可以运用他们的创造力和想象力设计和实施他们的科学实验，发现和解释他们的科学现象。
+ 第二个原因是创造力和想象力对大学生成功非常重要，它们对学生非常有价值，因为它可以帮助他们克服学习的困难和压力，激发他们对科学的热情。

+ I agree with the view that schools should encourage students to be creative and imaginative in order for them to be successful.
+ The first reason is that it can help students cope with the academic demands and challenges, students can use their creativity and imagination to design and implement their own scientific projects, to discover and explain their own scientific phenomena.
+ The second reason is that it is so significant for students to be successful with creativity and imagination, which are valuable for students as it can help them overcome the difficulties and pressure of the learning, and stimulate their enthusiasm and passion for science.

## Do you agree that it is more important to maintain the relationship with family members than with friends? 
+ 我认为家庭成员和朋友同等重要
+ 首先，友谊和亲情对每个人都非常重要，我们能够从爱我们的家人获得无条件的支持，我们也能够和我们的好朋友玩耍，成长，开心。
+ 再次，友谊和亲情在我们的生活中互相补充。尽管我们的父母无条件地爱着我们，但是有些事他们不会理解因为成长的环境。好朋友能够互相帮助，但是极少好朋友陪伴对方一辈子。

+ I think family members and friends are equally important.
+ First of all, friendship and family love are essential for everyone, we can gain unconditional support from family members who love us, we can also play, grow up, and have fun with our good friends.
+ Secondly, friendship and family affection complement in our life. Although our parents love us unconditionally, but they can't understand something because of the different environment of growing up. Good friends can help each other, but fewer friends can accompany others for a life time.

## Some people tend to judge a person on the basis of the first observation,  while other people believe that it takes a long time to know a person well. Which do you think is better?
+ 我认为需要花很长时间去真正了解一个人。
+ 首先，第一眼判断一个人不可靠，第一眼获得的信息是有限的，你无法从外表分辨出很多事情，比如他们的过去，饮食习惯，爱好等等
+ 再次，分辨一个人的品质需要花费大量的实践，比如正直，言行一致。这些品质非常重要并且不能在短时间内观察出来，它们都需要在一个人特定的场景或者特定的条件才会显现。

+ I believe that it takes a long time to truly know a person.
+ First of all, it's not reliable to judge a person at first glance, the information you can get from a glance is very limited, you can't discern many things just from appearance, such as their past, hobbies, eating habits, and so on.
+ Secondly, it should take a considerable amount of time to tell one's characteristics, such as honesty, consistency in one's words and actions. These qualities can't be discovered in a short time. they all need to be displayed by a person on certain occasions or under certain conditions.

## Do you agree that students should be allowed to take additional courses to graduate as soon as possible?
+ 我不同意学生应该参加额外的课程才能毕业。
+ 首先，学校应该根据大学生的接受能力为他们安排适当的课程，因为一个人的时间和精力是有限的，参加太多的课程对学生没有任何好处。
+ 其次，社会活动对学生来说同样重要，因为社会活动可以帮助学生了解社会的复杂性和多样性，同时为他们的未来生活和职业生涯做好准备。
+ I disagree that students should take additional courses to graduate.
+ First of all, schools should arrange proper courses for college students according to their ability to accept them, because the time and energe one has are limited, Taking too many courses does not bring any benefits to students.
+ Secondly, Social activities are equally important for students, because social acitivities can help students understand the **complexity** and diversity of society, as well as prepare them for their future life and career.

## Some students prefer to study alone, while others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? 
+ 我更喜欢独自学习。
+ 首先，我独自学习，我的学习效率很好，因为我能够专注于学习没有别人的打扰。我能够花费更多的时间和精力在思考上而不是和同伴聊天，交流或者玩耍，这对学习有负面影响。
+ 再次，独自学习更自由。我能根据自己的情况安排去哪，什么时候去学习，不需要考虑别人的感受，这对我非常重要，因为我很讨厌别人打乱我的个人计划。

+ I prefer to study alone.
+ First, my study efficiency is higher I study alone, because I can really focus on studying without others' distractions. I can spend more time and energy on thinking rather than **chatting**, talking or playing with **parnters**, which have a negative effect on learning.
+ Secondly, it's more free for me to study alone. I can arrange where and when to study according to my own situation and don't need to consider others' feelings, This is so essential for me since I really hate it when someone disrupt my personal plans.

## Do you agree that it is beneficial for students to set aside some time for group discussions in class?
+ 我认为在课堂上留出一些时间做小组讨论对学生有好处。
+ 首先，在课堂上交流他们的想法和经验对学生很重要，因为这对学生更好的理解老师教授的知识很有用。
+ 再次，小组讨论对学生来说能够培养他们的团队精神，沟通和协作能力，这也为它们以后的职业和生活做准备。

+ I agree that it is beneficial for students to set aside some time for group discussions in class.
+ First, it's so essential for students to exchange their ideas and experiences in class, as it is very useful for students to better understand knowledge **taught** by the teachers.
+ Secondly, group discussions are very helpful for students to cultivate their teamwork spirit, as well as communication and coordination skills, which will prepare them for their future career and life. 

## Some like to spend a lot of money to get a unique experience on vacations, while others prefer to spend only a little money on vacations. Which one do you prefer?
+ 我认为两个都可以，取决于个人的经济条件。
+ 首先如果你有足够的钱，你可以参加一些昂贵的活动在假期获取一些独特的经验，比如国外旅行，滑雪等等，这会成为你生命中的财富，丰富你的经历。
+ 第二，如果你经济上不富有，也有很多不贵但是有意义的事情可以在假期做，比如学习做美味的食物犒劳父母，参加社会实践活动挣点钱，这也能使得人更优秀。

+ I think both are ok, and it depends on personal **economical** conditions.
+ First of all, If you have enough money, you can take part in expensive activities to get **unique** experiences on vacation, such as travelling abroad, **skiing**, etc, which will become a **treasure** in your life and enrich your experiences.
+ Secondly, If you are not rich financially, there are still some inexpensive but meaningful things you can do during holidays, such as learning to make **delicious** **meals** to reward your parents, participating in social practice activities to earn money, which will also make people more **excellent**.

## Some college students like to join clubs and enjoy club activities in their spare time, while others like to use this time to study another course or do schoolwork. Which one do you think is better?
+ 我认为两个都应该经历。
+ 一方面，大学生有足够多的时间和精力允许他们参加一些俱乐部活动，这可以帮助他们增长阅历，结交朋友，培养能力和爱好，还能为他们未来的职业和生活做准备。
+ 另一方面，学习一些其他课程和完成学校作业也非常重要，因为这可以帮助他们应对学术的要求和挑战，顺利地完成他们的学业。

+ I think both should be experienced.
+ For one thing, college students have plenty of time and energy to **allow** them to take part in some club activities, it can help them **grow** experience, meet friends, develop abilities and hobbies, as well as prepare them for their future careers and lives.
+ For another thing, studying another courses and doing schoolwork is also important, because it can help them **cope** with academic demands and challenges and **complete** their studies **smoothly**.

## Some people like surprise visits from their friends, while others prefer to be informed of such visits. Which one do you prefer? (2015.2.1.NA)
+ 我更喜欢被告知这样的访问。
+ 首先，如果我知道我朋友要来访问我，我能够提前做一些准备，比如购买景点门票，根据天气条件制定旅游路线等等
+ 再次，我真的讨厌有人打乱我既定的安排，如果我朋友突然来访问我我会非常的不舒服，虽然我知道他或者她想给我一个惊喜，但是这可能会和我已经制定好的计划冲突。

+ I prefer to be informed of such visits.
+ First of all, if I know my friends will come to visit me, I can make some **preparations** for them in advance, such as **purchasing** scenic spot ticket, making tourist routes according to weather condition, etc.
+ Second, I really hate that someone upset my **established** schedule, I will be very uncomfortable if my friends suddenly come to visit me, although I know he or she want to give me a surprise, it may confluct with the plans I have already made.

## Do you agree that people should be forced to retire after the age of 65? (2014.12.6)
+ 我同意人们应该在65岁后被迫退休。
+ 首先，这对老年人有利，因为这是他们享受生活的最佳时期。当一个人在65岁退休时，他更可能拥有健康的身体和丰富的财务，退休后，他有足够的时间和金钱去旅行，拜访朋友等。
+ 其次，被迫退休并不意味着他就不能再工作了，如果一个人对工作真的有很大的热情，或者必须工作来赚钱，他可以以再就业的形式继续工作。 

+ I agree that people should be forced to retire after the age of 65.
+ First, it's beneficial for old people, because it's the best time for them to enjoy life. When one retire at the age of 65, he is more likely to have a healthy body and be rich financially, after retirement, he have enough time and money to travel, visit friends etc.
+ Secondly, being forced to retire doesn't mean he could never work again, if one really has great passion on work or has to work to earn money, he can continue to work in the forms of reemployment

## Do you agree that parents should use money as an incentive for kids to behave well in school?

+ 我同意这个观点。
+ 首先，这是一种有效的方式来引导孩子们努力学习。孩子们也需要钱来购买他们感兴趣的东西，所以这是他们在学校表现好，获得好成绩的动力，而好的成绩可以培养他们的自信心。
+ 其次，这种方法帮助孩子们培养他们对金钱的观念，即正确对待和使用金钱的能力。我们应该一生都要处理金钱。这种能力非常重要，需要尽早发展。

+ I agree with this view.
+ First of all, it's an efficient way to lead kids to study hard. Kids also need money to buy something they are interested in. so it is the motivation to behave well in school and good grades can cultivate their confidence.
+ Secondly, this method helps children foster their view of money which is the ability to treat and use money correctly. We are supposed to deal with money for a lifetime. This ability is so important that needs to be developed as early as possible.

## Some managers like to closely watch their employees, while others prefer to give their employees more freedom. Which do you think is more effective?

+ 我认为经理应该少关注他们的员工。
+ 首先，如果员工被领导紧密监视，他们会感到不舒服，他们会觉得自己没有得到尊重或重视，这也会影响员工的办公效率，因为他们无法专注于工作。
+ 其次，经理应该更多地关注自己的事情，花更多的时间和精力做好自己的工作，为员工树立一个好榜样，以便更好地带领部门取得更好的成果。

+ I think managers should pay less attention to their employees.
+ First, the employees will be uncomfortable if they are closely watched by their leader, they will feel that they are not respected or valued, which will also affect the office efficiency of the employees, as they can't focus on their work.
+ Secondly, managers are supposed to pay more attention to their own things and spend more time and effort to do their own work well to set an good example for their employees, so as to better lead the department to achieve better results.

## Your professor is asking you to help with some research work on the weekend, but you have planned to go to your sister’s birthday party. Which would you choose to do?
+ 我大概率会去参加我妹妹的生日。
+ 首先，我认为周末没有必要继续做实验，因为一天的时间也不能取得很大的进展，与其在实验室里浪费时间，我们还不如去做点别的事情放松一下心情.
+ 再次，我们需要合理地安排自己的时间，平衡我们的工作和娱乐，这样工作效率才会更高。周末是休息的时间，应该尽可能少的再去工作，因为这既破坏心情，又影响实验进展。

+ I will probably to go to my sister's birthday party.
+ First, I don't think it's necessary to continue doing research work on weekends, because we can't make munch progress on the weekend. Instead of wasting time in the lab, we should do something else to releax
+ Secondly, wo are supposed to arrange our time properly to balance the weight of our work and entertainment, so that our work will be more efficient. Weekend is the reset time and we should go to work as little as possibile, because it destorys our mood, and affect the progress of the research.

## （2016.06.25）Your community has been donated a piece of land. Should it be used to build an amusement center, or to grow trees and flowers

+ 我认为这两个选择都是可行的。
+ 一方面，建设一个娱乐中心可以为大家提供一个休闲娱乐的场所。这对社区的所有居民都非常有益，因为它可以帮助人们在一天的工作或学习后放松心情，享受生活。
+ 另一方面，种植一些花草树木可以使社区变得更加宜居。这对所有人都有很多好处，因为它可以美化社区，净化空气，并提供一个舒适的环境，使大家在生活和学习中拥有更好的心情。

+ I believe both options are viable.
+ On one hand, building an entertainment center can provide everyone with a place for leisure and enjoyment. This is very beneficial for all residents in the community, as it can help people relax and enjoy life after a day of work or study.
+ On the other hand, planting some flowers and trees can make the community more livable. This also has many benefits for everyone, as it can beautify the community, purify the air, and provide a comfortable environment that makes everyone have a better mood for life and study.

## Do you agree that experienced doctors are better than young doctors? (2016.7.2)

+ 这个观点并不一定完全准确。
+ 首先，经验丰富的医生在医术上确实可能优于年轻医生，因为他们处理过众多病例，进行过大量手术，知道如何与病人沟通，以及如何根据不同症状进行用药。这些经验对于治疗病人来说是非常重要的。
+ 然而，年轻医生也有他们自身的优势。他们有充足的时间进行学习，有足够的热情与病人交流，同时也有无限的潜力。因此，我们不应该简单地用好或不好来评价年轻的医生，而应该为他们创造条件，让他们能够尽快成长。

+ This viewpoint is not necessarily entirely accurate.
+ Firstly, experienced doctors may indeed be superior in medical skills compared to young doctors, as they have handled numerous cases, performed a large number of **surgeries**, know how to communicate with patients, and how to medicate based on different symptoms. These experiences are very important for treating patients.
+ However, young doctors also have their own advantages. They have ample time to learn, enough enthusiasm to talk with patients, and unlimited potential. Therefore, we should not simply evaluate young doctors as good or bad, but should create conditions for them to grow as quickly as possible.

## Do you agree that it’s impolite to make calls or send text messages on a dinner table?(2016.7.3)

+ 我赞同这个观点
+ 首先，这样的行为对共餐的人缺乏尊重。当有人在餐桌上使用手机时，他的注意力会被分散，无法全心全意地投入到餐桌上的交流中。这可能会让其他人感到被忽视或者不受重视，从而破坏了餐桌上的和谐氛围。
+ 其次，餐桌上的时间应该是用来享受美食、与他人交流以及建立更深的人际关系的时间。然而，使用手机会破坏这种轻松愉快的氛围，可能会让其他人觉得你并不珍视此时的陪伴和交流。

+ I agree with this view.
+ Firstly, such behavior shows a lack of respect for the people sharing the meal. When someone uses a mobile phone at the dining table, their attention is **diverted** and they cannot fully engage in the conversation at the table. This might make others feel **ignored** or unimportant, thereby disrupting the **harmonious** atmosphere at the table.
+ Secondly, the time at the dining table should be used to enjoy food, communicate with others, and build deeper interpersonal relationships. However, using a mobile phone can disrupt this relaxed and pleasant atmosphere, and may make others feel that you do not value their company and conversation at this time.

## Do you agree that it’s easier to teach primary school kids than university students?(2016.7.9)

+ 我并不同意这个观点。
+ 首先，中学生的年纪较小不够成熟，教师不仅需要教授他们知识，批改他们的作业，还需要关注他们的身心健康。此外，老师还需要与他们的父母沟通，讨论他们的学业进展和在学校的表现，这些会耗费老师很多时间和精力。
+ 然而，教授大学生则相对轻松一些。因为他们已经是成年人，他们已经形成了成熟的世界观和价值观。老师的主要任务就是在课堂上传授知识，并不需要过多地关注他们，允许他们根据自己的情况规划自己的未来。

+ I don’t agree with this viewpoint. On the contrary, I believe that teaching university students is somewhat easier than teaching primary school students.
+ Firstly, primary school students are younger and less mature，teachers not only need to teach them knowledge and correct their homework, but also need to pay attention to their physical and mental health. In addition, teachers need to communicate with their parents, discuss their academic progress and performance in school, and help them grow healthily as much as possible. These tasks are very time-consuming and energy-consuming.
+ However, teaching university students is relatively easier. Because university students are adults, they have formed mature worldviews and values. The main task of teachers is to impart knowledge in the classroom, and don’t need to pay too much attention to them, allowing them to plan their future according to their own situation.

## Task 2: Do you agree that it is important to learn about the history of the city you live in?（2016.7.10）

+ 我认为了解生活所在城市的历史非常重要。
+ 首先，这有助于扩展我们的知识基础和视野。一个城市的历史是一个丰富的教育资源，通过了解这段历史，我们可以学习到发生在这个城市的事件、变化和趋势，这些都可以增加我们的知识储备，从而更好地理解现在和未来。
+ 其次，了解城市的历史可以增强我们对这座城市的归属感和参与感。这不仅可以帮助我们更好地融入生活的城市，而且还能帮助我们理解城市的文化、建筑和社区的起源和发展，这些都对我们的成长有着极大的益处

+ I believe that understanding the history of the city where we live is very important.
+ Firstly, this helps to expand our knowledge base and broaden our horizons. The history of a city is a rich educational resource. By understanding this history, we can learn about the events, changes, and trends that have occurred in the city. This can enhance our knowledge reserve, enabling us to better understand the present and the future.
+ Secondly, understanding the city’s history can enhance our sense of belonging and participation in the city. This not only helps us to better integrate into the city where we live, but also helps us understand the origins and development of the city’s culture, architecture, and communities. All of these are greatly beneficial to our growth.

## Task 2: Do you agree that it is okay for people to use surgeries to change their appearance?(2016.7.16)

+ 我非常不赞同做这种事。
+ 首先，外貌并不能代表一个人的所有。人们确实会因为外貌影响对他人的第一印象，但是还有其他更品质会比外貌更重要，比如正直诚实的品行，勤劳美好的德行，这些对于一个人的工作和生活更重要。
+ 再次，我们还有其他更好的方法来改变外貌，比如坚持运动保持一个积极的生活心态，早起早睡培养一个健康的生活作息，多读书可以武装我们的思想等等，这些措施都可以潜移默化的修改我们的外貌，让我们变得更好看。

+ I strongly disagree with doing this.
+ First of all, appearance does not represent everything about a person. People indeed form first impressions based on appearance, but there are other qualities that are more important than appearance, such as honesty and diligence. These qualities are more important for a person’s work and life.
+ Furthermore, we have other better ways to change our appearance, such as maintaining a positive lifestyle by exercising regularly, cultivating a healthy daily routine by getting up early and going to bed early, and enriching our minds by reading more. These measures can subtly change our appearance and make us look better.

## Some people prefer to watch entertainment programs on television, while  others prefer to watch educational programs. Which do you prefer?（2016.08.20）

+ 我更喜欢娱乐节目
+ 首先，娱乐节目通常比较有趣和轻松，这帮助我在忙碌一天后放松身心，调节情绪。而且热门的娱乐节目往往都是人们社交时的话题，看些娱乐节目可以让我更好的与朋友，家人和同事交流。
+ 再次，通过观看不同类型的娱乐节目，我能接触到多元的文化元素，培养审美观，增加文化素养，扩展眼界。此外有些娱乐节目非常有创造力，能够帮助我们发散思维，激发我们的想象力和创造力。

+ I prefer entertainment programs.
+ Firstly, entertainment programs are usually more interesting and relaxing, which helps me unwind and adjust my mood after a busy day. Moreover, popular entertainment programs often become topics of social conversation. Watching these programs allows me to better communicate with friends, family, and colleagues.
+ Secondly, by watching different types of entertainment programs, I can be exposed to diverse cultural elements, cultivate aesthetic appreciation, increase cultural literacy, and broaden my horizons. In addition, some entertainment programs are very creative, which can help us diverge our thinking, stimulate our imagination and creativity.
