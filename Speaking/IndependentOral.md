## Do you agree or disagree	that holding different opinions	will hurt friendship?
+ 我不同意持有不同观点会伤害友情这一看法。
+ 首先每个人的背景，文化，成长环境各不相同，两个人对于一件事的持有不同观点是一个非常正常的事情，所以我们应该理解包容这种差异和不同。
+ 再次，朋友之间的不同观点可以增加对彼此的理解和接纳，使得友谊变得更加丰富和有意义。我们需要做的是如何通过良好的沟通来维护这段友谊。

## Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should	not interrupt others when they are giving opinions.
+ 我同意这个观点。
+ 首先打断别人说话本身就是一件很不礼貌的事情。这会让人感觉到他们的观点不被尊重或者不被重视，除非是在一些紧急的情况下或者需要纠正别的人错误的时候。尊重他人的发言时良好沟通的基础。
+ 再次打断别人表达观点会影响沟通交流的效率。在和别人沟通的过程中，如果每个人都去打断别人的发言，只会浪费所有人的时间和精力。所以为了高效地和别人交流，听完别人的发言再说话是一个非常有用的策略。

## Some	secondary school require that every student’s schedule include study hall, which is a free class period during the school day in which students can	do class assignments or rest. do you think this is a good idea? why or why not? use details and examples in your response.
+ 我认为这是一个好的主意。
+ 首先在课堂上听老师教授知识是一个输入的过程，而做课堂作业是一个将学到的知识输出的过程，所以初中生需要一个合适的地方完成作业，以及休息，这对他们的学习都很重要。
+ 再次不是所有的初中生在放学回去以后都能有一个安静的地方，甚至时间来完成老师在课堂上布置的作业，所以在学校安排一个教室和一点时间允许他们在回家之前就完成作业是一件很有必要的事情。

+ I would like to make a plan with my friends about social acitivities.
+ The first reason is that it can save time for all participants. Making a good plan can tell everyone what we need to do, when and where to do it. Although the social activities may not proceed exactly as planned, at least we know what our goal is and what we should do.

+ I think the natural talent is more important than hard work to the success of an artist.
+ The first reason is that natural talent sets the upper limit for a person, especially for an artist. People who are born with high talent are more likely to come up with good ideas, or draw inspiration from things in their life or imagination, Therefore it is easier for them to create extraordinary works of art.

+ Secondly, friendship and family affection complement in our life. Although our parents love us unconditionally, but they can't understand something because of the different environment of growing up. Good friends can help each other, but fewer friends can accompany others for a life time.

## Some people tend to judge a person on the basis of the first observation,  while other people believe that it takes a long time to know a person well. Which do you think is better?
+ I believe that it takes a long time to truly know a person.
+ First of all, it's not reliable to judge a person at first glance, the information you can get from a glance is very limited, you can't discern many things just from appearance, such as their past, hobbies, eating habits, and so on.
+ Secondly, it should take a considerable amount of time to tell one's characteristics, such as honesty, consistency in one's words and actions. These qualities can't be discovered in a short time. they all need to be displayed by a person on certain occasions or under certain conditions.

## Do you agree that students should be allowed to take additional courses to graduate as soon as possible?
+ 我不同意学生应该参加额外的课程才能毕业。
+ 首先，学校应该根据大学生的接受能力为他们安排适当的课程，因为一个人的时间和精力是有限的，参加太多的课程对学生没有任何好处。
+ 其次，社会活动对学生来说同样重要，因为社会活动可以帮助学生了解社会的复杂性和多样性，同时为他们的未来生活和职业生涯做好准备。
+ I disagree that students should take additional courses to graduate.
+ First of all, schools should arrange proper courses for college students according to their ability to accept them, because the time and energe one has are limited, Taking too many courses does not bring any benefits to students.
+ Secondly, Social activities are equally important for students, because social acitivities can help students understand the complexity and diversity of society, as well as prepare them for their future life and career.
