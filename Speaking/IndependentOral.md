# Practice 2016-2018

## Some people buy food that is already prepared. Other people buy fresh food and prepare meals themselves. Which do you prefer?(2016-01-09)(need to write again)

+ 我倾向于选择现成的食物。
+ 首先，这样做能大幅节约我的时间——无需购物、准备食材、烹饪以及清洁厨房。我可以利用节省下来的时间去从事我感兴趣的活动，如游泳、骑自行车和阅读，这些活动对我的身心健康都大有裨益。
+ 此外，这也丰富了我的生活体验和见识。我有机会探索不同的餐饮文化、尝试多样的菜肴和餐厅，通过品味各式各样的美食来了解不同地区和国家的文化，这对我的个人成长极为有益

+ I prefer buying food that is already prepared.
+ Firstly, this approach saves me a significant amount of time --- eliminating the need for shopping, food preparation, cooking, and kitchen cleanup. I can use the time saved to engage in activities I enjoy, such as swimming, cycling, and reading, all of which are beneficial to my physical and mental health.
+ Additionally, it enriches my life experiences and broadens my horizons. I have the opportunity to explore diverse **culinary** cultures, try a variety of **dishes** and restaurants, and through **savoring** a wide range of **cuisines**, I gain insights into the cultures of different regions and countries, which is **immensely** helpful for my personal growth.

##  Do you agree that celebrities are good examples for young people? 

+ 我持有不同意见，认为名人并非年轻人理想的榜样。
+ 首先，尽管名人广为人知，但他们不一定具备对年轻人成长至关重要的其他优良品质，如正直、远见或能力。缺乏这些品质却拥有巨大影响力的名人，可能会误导年轻人的价值观。
+ 其次，我相信，只有那些为社会和国家做出显著贡献的人，如科学家、杰出教师和伟大政治家，才真正有资格成为年轻人的良好榜样。他们的贡献不仅意义深远，而且值得年轻人效仿和学习

+ I hold a different opinion, believing that celebrities are not ideal role models for the youth. 
+ Firstly, despite their fame, celebrities may not possess other excellent qualities that are crucial for the growth of young people, such as integrity, foresight, or capability. Celebrities lacking these qualities but with significant influence can easily mislead the values of the young. 
+ Secondly, I believe that only those who have made significant contributions to society and the country, such as scientists, outstanding teachers, and great politicians, truly deserve to be good role models for the youth. Their contributions are not only meaningful but also worthy of emulation and learning by the young.

## Some people prefer to make a plan with their friends about social activities, while others prefer to decide about what to do when they meet their friends. Which do you prefer?

+ 我喜欢和我的朋友制定关于社会活动的计划。
+ 首先，这样做可以提高效率并节省时间。通过提前与朋友规划，我们可以合理安排所有参与者的时间，确保活动有序进行，避免因临时安排而产生的混乱和压力，从而使活动更加迅速和高效地完成。
+ 此外，提前规划可以增加成功举办社会活动的可能性。在活动准备过程中，我们可以做足充分准备，例如携带必要的设备，穿着适当的服装和鞋子，这些都对活动的成功至关重要。

+ I would like to make a plan with my friends about social acitivities.
+ Firstly, it can enhance efficiency and save time. By planning ahead with friends, we can allocate everyone’s time effectively, ensuring the event proceeds smoothly and avoiding the chaos and pressure that come with last-minute arrangements, which helps the event to be completed more quickly and efficiently.
+ Moreover, planning in advance can increase the likelihood of successfully holding a social event. During the preparation process, we can make thorough preparations, such as bringing necessary equipment and wearing appropriate clothes and shoes, all of which are very helpful for the success of the event.

## Do you agree that universities are successful because of experienced professors?
+ 我不同意这个观点，大学的成功不仅仅取决于有经验的教授。
+ 首先，学生是大学的核心，学生的道德水平，学术成就和创新能力直接影响大学的声誉，学生积极地参与研究项目，国际竞赛提升学校的知名度，这些对大学的成功都是至关重要的因素。
+ 再次，校园设施和资源也非常重要，比如图书馆，实验室，体育设施等等这些现代化的校园设施能够极大影响学生的学习体验和满意度。良好的设施也能吸引顶尖的教师和研究人员，进一步提升大学的教学和研究水平。

+ I disagree with this view; the success of a university does not solely depend on experienced professors.
+ Firstly, students are the heart of a university. Their moral standards, academic achievements, and innovative capabilities directly impact the university’s reputation. Students’ active participation in research projects and international competitions enhances the school’s visibility, which are crucial factors for the university’s success.
+ Secondly, campus facilities and resources are also very important. Modern campus facilities such as libraries, laboratories, and sports facilities can greatly affect students’ learning experiences and satisfaction. Good facilities can also attract top teachers and researchers, further improving the university’s teaching and research levels.

## Which is more important to the success of an artist: natural talent or hard work?

+ 对于艺术家而言，天赋与努力同等重要。
+ 首先，天赋是艺术创作的重要组成部分，它是艺术家与生俱来的独特能力。拥有天赋的艺术家能够直观地洞察艺术的精髓，轻松捕捉灵感，并且更有可能创作出杰出的作品。
+ 其次，努力对于艺术家的成功同样不可或缺。艺术创作是一个持续的学习与成长过程，即便是最有天赋的艺术家也必须不懈努力，以磨砺技艺，开阔艺术视野。只有这样，他们才能创造出能够超越时代的艺术佳作。

+ For artists, both talent and effort are of paramount importance.
+ Firstly, talent plays a crucial role in the creation of art; it is an innate ability that artists are born with. Artists with talent can intuitively understand the essence of art, easily capture inspiration, and are more likely to produce extraordinary works.
+ Secondly, hard work is equally vital for success. The process of artistic creation is also one of continuous learning and growth. Even the most talented artists need to tirelessly hone their skills and broaden their artistic horizons. Only through persistent effort can they create timeless masterpieces that transcend the ages.

## Do you agree that schools should encourage students to be creative and imaginative in order for them to be successful?

+ 我赞同这种看法。
+ 首先，它能够促进学生更好地适应未来的挑战。在这个日新月异的世界里，无论是职场还是日常生活，创新和解决问题的能力都至关重要，而想象力与创造力是这些能力的根本。
+ 其次，想象力和创造力对学生的个人学习和成长也大有裨益。这些能力不仅能帮助学生满足学术要求，应对各种挑战，还能培养他们的好奇心和探索欲，激发终身学习的热情。这对于学生未来的职业道路和生活质量都极为重要。

+ I agree with this perspective.
+ Firstly, it helps students better adapt to future challenges. In our rapidly changing world, both the workplace and everyday life require the ability to innovate and solve complex problems, and imagination and creativity are the foundations of these skills.
+ Secondly, imagination and creativity also greatly benefit students’ personal learning and development. These abilities not only help students meet academic demands and face various challenges but also cultivate their curiosity and desire to explore, inspiring a passion for lifelong learning. This is extremely important for students’ future career paths and quality of life.

## Do you agree that it is more important to maintain the relationship with family members than with friends?

+ 家人和朋友都是生活中非常重要的存在，它们各自在我们的生活中扮演着不同但同样重要的角色。
+ 家人通常是我们最初的社会联系，为我们提供了基本的情感支持、安全感和归属感。他们在我们成长的过程中起着至关重要的作用，教会我们许多基本的生活技能和价值观。
+ 朋友则是我们选择与之共度时光的人。他们丰富了我们的社交生活，提供了不同的观点和经验，帮助我们扩展视野。在许多情况下，朋友可以成为我们的精神支柱，与我们分享快乐和悲伤。

+ Both family and friends are very important in life, each playing different but equally significant roles.
+ Family is usually our first social connection, providing us with emotional support, security, and a sense of belonging. They play a crucial role in our upbringing, teaching us many basic life skills and values.
+ Friends are the people we choose to spend our time with. They enrich our social lives, offer different perspectives and experiences, and help us broaden our horizons. In many cases, friends can become our emotional pillars, sharing in our joys and sorrows.

## Some people tend to judge a person on the basis of the first observation,  while other people believe that it takes a long time to know a person well. Which do you think is better?

+ 我认为想要真正了解一个人，是一个漫长的过程
+ 首先，了解一个人需要建立深厚的信任。这不仅包括对他们的兴趣和习惯的认识，更涉及对他们内心世界和道德观的理解。信任的建立基于长期的相处、共同的经历和相互的支持
+ 再次，了解一个人是一个持续的过程。每个人的人格特质都是复杂且多变的，随着时间和经历的积累而演变。因此，我们需要在不同的情境中观察他们的行为、思想和情感反应。

+ I believe that truly understanding a person is a long journey.
+ Firstly, understanding someone requires the establishment of profound trust. This involves not only recognizing their interests and habits but also comprehending their inner world and moral values. Trust is built on long-term companionship, shared experiences, and mutual support.
+ Furthermore, understanding a person is an ongoing process. Everyone has complex and evolving personality traits that change over time and through experiences. Therefore, we need to observe their behaviors, thoughts, and emotional responses in various situations.

## Do you agree that students should be allowed to take additional courses to graduate as soon as possible?
+ 我不同意学生应该参加额外的课程才能毕业。
+ 首先，学校应该根据大学生的接受能力为他们安排适当的课程，因为一个人的时间和精力是有限的，参加太多的课程对学生没有任何好处。
+ 其次，社会活动对学生来说同样重要，因为社会活动可以帮助学生了解社会的复杂性和多样性，同时为他们的未来生活和职业生涯做好准备。
+ I disagree that students should take additional courses to graduate.
+ First of all, schools should arrange proper courses for college students according to their ability to accept them, because the time and energe one has are limited, Taking too many courses does not bring any benefits to students.
+ Secondly, Social activities are equally important for students, because social acitivities can help students understand the **complexity** and diversity of society, as well as prepare them for their future life and career.

## Some students prefer to study alone, while others prefer to study with a group of students. Which do you prefer? 
+ 我更喜欢独自学习。
+ 首先，我独自学习，我的学习效率很好，因为我能够专注于学习没有别人的打扰。我能够花费更多的时间和精力在思考上而不是和同伴聊天，交流或者玩耍，这对学习有负面影响。
+ 再次，独自学习更自由。我能根据自己的情况安排去哪，什么时候去学习，不需要考虑别人的感受，这对我非常重要，因为我很讨厌别人打乱我的个人计划。

+ I prefer to study alone.
+ First, my study efficiency is higher I study alone, because I can really focus on studying without others' distractions. I can spend more time and energy on thinking rather than **chatting**, talking or playing with **parnters**, which have a negative effect on learning.
+ Secondly, it's more free for me to study alone. I can arrange where and when to study according to my own situation and don't need to consider others' feelings, This is so essential for me since I really hate it when someone disrupt my personal plans.

## Do you agree that it is beneficial for students to set aside some time for group discussions in class?
+ 我认为在课堂上留出一些时间做小组讨论对学生有好处。
+ 首先，在课堂上交流他们的想法和经验对学生很重要，因为这对学生更好的理解老师教授的知识很有用。
+ 再次，小组讨论对学生来说能够培养他们的团队精神，沟通和协作能力，这也为它们以后的职业和生活做准备。

+ I agree that it is beneficial for students to set aside some time for group discussions in class.
+ First, it's so essential for students to exchange their ideas and experiences in class, as it is very useful for students to better understand knowledge **taught** by the teachers.
+ Secondly, group discussions are very helpful for students to cultivate their teamwork spirit, as well as communication and coordination skills, which will prepare them for their future career and life. 

## Some like to spend a lot of money to get a unique experience on vacations, while others prefer to spend only a little money on vacations. Which one do you prefer?
+ 我认为两个都可以，取决于个人的经济条件。
+ 首先如果你有足够的钱，你可以参加一些昂贵的活动在假期获取一些独特的经验，比如国外旅行，滑雪等等，这会成为你生命中的财富，丰富你的经历。
+ 第二，如果你经济上不富有，也有很多不贵但是有意义的事情可以在假期做，比如学习做美味的食物犒劳父母，参加社会实践活动挣点钱，这也能使得人更优秀。

+ I think both are ok, and it depends on personal **economical** conditions.
+ First of all, If you have enough money, you can take part in expensive activities to get **unique** experiences on vacation, such as travelling abroad, **skiing**, etc, which will become a **treasure** in your life and enrich your experiences.
+ Secondly, If you are not rich financially, there are still some inexpensive but meaningful things you can do during holidays, such as learning to make **delicious** **meals** to reward your parents, participating in social practice activities to earn money, which will also make people more **excellent**.

## Some college students like to join clubs and enjoy club activities in their spare time, while others like to use this time to study another course or do schoolwork. Which one do you think is better?
+ 我认为两个都应该经历。
+ 一方面，大学生有足够多的时间和精力允许他们参加一些俱乐部活动，这可以帮助他们增长阅历，结交朋友，培养能力和爱好，还能为他们未来的职业和生活做准备。
+ 另一方面，学习一些其他课程和完成学校作业也非常重要，因为这可以帮助他们应对学术的要求和挑战，顺利地完成他们的学业。

+ I think both should be experienced.
+ For one thing, college students have plenty of time and energy to **allow** them to take part in some club activities, it can help them **grow** experience, meet friends, develop abilities and hobbies, as well as prepare them for their future careers and lives.
+ For another thing, studying another courses and doing schoolwork is also important, because it can help them **cope** with academic demands and challenges and **complete** their studies **smoothly**.

## Some people like surprise visits from their friends, while others prefer to be informed of such visits. Which one do you prefer? (2015.2.1.NA)
+ 我更喜欢被告知这样的访问。
+ 首先，如果我知道我朋友要来访问我，我能够提前做一些准备，比如购买景点门票，根据天气条件制定旅游路线等等
+ 再次，我真的讨厌有人打乱我既定的安排，如果我朋友突然来访问我我会非常的不舒服，虽然我知道他或者她想给我一个惊喜，但是这可能会和我已经制定好的计划冲突。

+ I prefer to be informed of such visits.
+ First of all, if I know my friends will come to visit me, I can make some **preparations** for them in advance, such as **purchasing** scenic spot ticket, making tourist routes according to weather condition, etc.
+ Second, I really hate that someone upset my **established** schedule, I will be very uncomfortable if my friends suddenly come to visit me, although I know he or she want to give me a surprise, it may confluct with the plans I have already made.

## Do you agree that people should be forced to retire after the age of 65? (2014.12.6)
+ 我同意人们应该在65岁后被迫退休。
+ 首先，这对老年人有利，因为这是他们享受生活的最佳时期。当一个人在65岁退休时，他更可能拥有健康的身体和丰富的财务，退休后，他有足够的时间和金钱去旅行，拜访朋友等。
+ 其次，被迫退休并不意味着他就不能再工作了，如果一个人对工作真的有很大的热情，或者必须工作来赚钱，他可以以再就业的形式继续工作。 

+ I agree that people should be forced to retire after the age of 65.
+ First, it's beneficial for old people, because it's the best time for them to enjoy life. When one retire at the age of 65, he is more likely to have a healthy body and be rich financially, after retirement, he have enough time and money to travel, visit friends etc.
+ Secondly, being forced to retire doesn't mean he could never work again, if one really has great passion on work or has to work to earn money, he can continue to work in the forms of reemployment

## Do you agree that parents should use money as an incentive for kids to behave well in school?

+ 我同意这个观点。
+ 首先，这是一种有效的方式来引导孩子们努力学习。孩子们也需要钱来购买他们感兴趣的东西，所以这是他们在学校表现好，获得好成绩的动力，而好的成绩可以培养他们的自信心。
+ 其次，这种方法帮助孩子们培养他们对金钱的观念，即正确对待和使用金钱的能力。我们应该一生都要处理金钱。这种能力非常重要，需要尽早发展。

+ I agree with this view.
+ First of all, it's an efficient way to lead kids to study hard. Kids also need money to buy something they are interested in. so it is the motivation to behave well in school and good grades can cultivate their confidence.
+ Secondly, this method helps children foster their view of money which is the ability to treat and use money correctly. We are supposed to deal with money for a lifetime. This ability is so important that needs to be developed as early as possible.

## Some managers like to closely watch their employees, while others prefer to give their employees more freedom. Which do you think is more effective?

+ 我认为经理应该少关注他们的员工。
+ 首先，如果员工被领导紧密监视，他们会感到不舒服，他们会觉得自己没有得到尊重或重视，这也会影响员工的办公效率，因为他们无法专注于工作。
+ 其次，经理应该更多地关注自己的事情，花更多的时间和精力做好自己的工作，为员工树立一个好榜样，以便更好地带领部门取得更好的成果。

+ I think managers should pay less attention to their employees.
+ First, the employees will be uncomfortable if they are closely watched by their leader, they will feel that they are not respected or valued, which will also affect the office efficiency of the employees, as they can't focus on their work.
+ Secondly, managers are supposed to pay more attention to their own things and spend more time and effort to do their own work well to set an good example for their employees, so as to better lead the department to achieve better results.

## Your professor is asking you to help with some research work on the weekend, but you have planned to go to your sister’s birthday party. Which would you choose to do?
+ 我大概率会去参加我妹妹的生日。
+ 首先，我认为周末没有必要继续做实验，因为一天的时间也不能取得很大的进展，与其在实验室里浪费时间，我们还不如去做点别的事情放松一下心情.
+ 再次，我们需要合理地安排自己的时间，平衡我们的工作和娱乐，这样工作效率才会更高。周末是休息的时间，应该尽可能少的再去工作，因为这既破坏心情，又影响实验进展。

+ I will probably to go to my sister's birthday party.
+ First, I don't think it's necessary to continue doing research work on weekends, because we can't make munch progress on the weekend. Instead of wasting time in the lab, we should do something else to releax
+ Secondly, wo are supposed to arrange our time properly to balance the weight of our work and entertainment, so that our work will be more efficient. Weekend is the reset time and we should go to work as little as possibile, because it destorys our mood, and affect the progress of the research.

## （2016.06.25）Your community has been donated a piece of land. Should it be used to build an amusement center, or to grow trees and flowers

+ 我认为这两个选择都是可行的。
+ 一方面，建设一个娱乐中心可以为大家提供一个休闲娱乐的场所。这对社区的所有居民都非常有益，因为它可以帮助人们在一天的工作或学习后放松心情，享受生活。
+ 另一方面，种植一些花草树木可以使社区变得更加宜居。这对所有人都有很多好处，因为它可以美化社区，净化空气，并提供一个舒适的环境，使大家在生活和学习中拥有更好的心情。

+ I believe both options are viable.
+ On one hand, building an entertainment center can provide everyone with a place for leisure and enjoyment. This is very beneficial for all residents in the community, as it can help people relax and enjoy life after a day of work or study.
+ On the other hand, planting some flowers and trees can make the community more livable. This also has many benefits for everyone, as it can beautify the community, purify the air, and provide a comfortable environment that makes everyone have a better mood for life and study.

## Do you agree that experienced doctors are better than young doctors? (2016.7.2)

+ 这个观点并不一定完全准确。
+ 首先，经验丰富的医生在医术上确实可能优于年轻医生，因为他们处理过众多病例，进行过大量手术，知道如何与病人沟通，以及如何根据不同症状进行用药。这些经验对于治疗病人来说是非常重要的。
+ 然而，年轻医生也有他们自身的优势。他们有充足的时间进行学习，有足够的热情与病人交流，同时也有无限的潜力。因此，我们不应该简单地用好或不好来评价年轻的医生，而应该为他们创造条件，让他们能够尽快成长。

+ This viewpoint is not necessarily entirely accurate.
+ Firstly, experienced doctors may indeed be superior in medical skills compared to young doctors, as they have handled numerous cases, performed a large number of **surgeries**, know how to communicate with patients, and how to medicate based on different symptoms. These experiences are very important for treating patients.
+ However, young doctors also have their own advantages. They have ample time to learn, enough enthusiasm to talk with patients, and unlimited potential. Therefore, we should not simply evaluate young doctors as good or bad, but should create conditions for them to grow as quickly as possible.

## Do you agree that it’s impolite to make calls or send text messages on a dinner table?(2016.7.3)

+ 我赞同这个观点
+ 首先，这样的行为对共餐的人缺乏尊重。当有人在餐桌上使用手机时，他的注意力会被分散，无法全心全意地投入到餐桌上的交流中。这可能会让其他人感到被忽视或者不受重视，从而破坏了餐桌上的和谐氛围。
+ 其次，餐桌上的时间应该是用来享受美食、与他人交流以及建立更深的人际关系的时间。然而，使用手机会破坏这种轻松愉快的氛围，可能会让其他人觉得你并不珍视此时的陪伴和交流。

+ I agree with this view.
+ Firstly, such behavior shows a lack of respect for the people sharing the meal. When someone uses a mobile phone at the dining table, their attention is **diverted** and they cannot fully engage in the conversation at the table. This might make others feel **ignored** or unimportant, thereby disrupting the **harmonious** atmosphere at the table.
+ Secondly, the time at the dining table should be used to enjoy food, communicate with others, and build deeper interpersonal relationships. However, using a mobile phone can disrupt this relaxed and pleasant atmosphere, and may make others feel that you do not value their company and conversation at this time.

## Do you agree that it’s easier to teach primary school kids than university students?(2016.7.9)

+ 我并不同意这个观点。
+ 首先，中学生的年纪较小不够成熟，教师不仅需要教授他们知识，批改他们的作业，还需要关注他们的身心健康。此外，老师还需要与他们的父母沟通，讨论他们的学业进展和在学校的表现，这些会耗费老师很多时间和精力。
+ 然而，教授大学生则相对轻松一些。因为他们已经是成年人，他们已经形成了成熟的世界观和价值观。老师的主要任务就是在课堂上传授知识，并不需要过多地关注他们，允许他们根据自己的情况规划自己的未来。

+ I don’t agree with this viewpoint. On the contrary, I believe that teaching university students is somewhat easier than teaching primary school students.
+ Firstly, primary school students are younger and less mature，teachers not only need to teach them knowledge and correct their homework, but also need to pay attention to their physical and mental health. In addition, teachers need to communicate with their parents, discuss their academic progress and performance in school, and help them grow healthily as much as possible. These tasks are very time-consuming and energy-consuming.
+ However, teaching university students is relatively easier. Because university students are adults, they have formed mature worldviews and values. The main task of teachers is to impart knowledge in the classroom, and don’t need to pay too much attention to them, allowing them to plan their future according to their own situation.

## Task 2: Do you agree that it is important to learn about the history of the city you live in?（2016.7.10）

+ 我同意这个观点。
+ 首先，这有助于扩展我们的知识基础和视野。一个城市的历史是一个丰富的教育资源，通过了解这段历史，我们可以学习到发生在这个城市的事件、变化和趋势，这些都可以增加我们的知识储备.
+ 其次，这可以帮助我们更好地融入生活的城市，了解城市的历史可以帮助我们理解城市的文化、建筑和社区的起源和发展，这些都对我们的成长有着极大的益处。

+ I agree with this view.
+ Firstly, this helps to expand our knowledge base and broaden our horizons. The history of a city is a rich educational resource. By understanding this history, we can learn about the events, changes, and trends that have occurred in this city, which can enhance our knowledge reserve。
+ Secondly, it can help us to better integrate into the city where we live. Knowing the city’s history can help us appreciate the origins and development of the city’s culture, architecture, and communities, which are greatly beneficial to our growth. 

## Task 2: Do you agree that it is okay for people to use surgeries to change their appearance?(2016.7.16)

+ 我非常不赞同做这种事。
+ 首先，外貌并不能代表一个人的所有。人们确实会因为外貌影响对他人的第一印象，但是还有其他更品质会比外貌更重要，比如正直和勤劳，这些对于一个人的工作和生活更重要。
+ 再次，我们还有其他更好的方法来改变外貌，比如坚持运动保持一个积极的生活心态，早起早睡培养一个健康的生活作息，多读书可以武装我们的思想等等，这些措施都可以潜移默化的修改我们的外貌，让我们变得更好看。

+ I strongly disagree with doing this.
+ First of all, appearance does not represent everything about a person. People indeed form first impressions based on appearance, but there are other qualities that are more important than appearance, such as **honesty** and **diligence**. These qualities are more essential for a person’s work and life.
+ Furthermore, we have other better ways to change our appearance, such as maintaining a positive lifestyle by **exercising** regularly, cultivating a healthy daily routine by getting up early and going to bed early, and enriching our minds by reading more. These measures can subtly change our appearance and make us look better.

## Some people prefer to watch entertainment programs on television, while  others prefer to watch educational programs. Which do you prefer?（2016.08.20）

+ 我更喜欢娱乐节目
+ 首先，娱乐节目通常比较有趣和轻松，这帮助我在忙碌一天后放松身心，调节情绪。而且热门的娱乐节目往往都是人们社交时的话题，看这些节目可以让我更好的与朋友，家人和同事交流。
+ 再次，通过观看不同类型的娱乐节目，我能接触到多元的文化元素，培养审美观，增加文化素养，扩展眼界。此外有些娱乐节目非常有创造力，能够帮助我们发散思维，激发我们的想象力和创造力。

+ I prefer entertainment programs.
+ Firstly, entertainment programs are usually more interesting and relaxing, which helps me unwind and adjust my mood after a busy day. Moreover, popular entertainment programs often become topics of social conversation. Watching these programs allows me to better communicate with friends, family, and colleagues.
+ Secondly, by watching different types of entertainment programs, I can be exposed to diverse cultural elements, cultivate aesthetic appreciation, increase cultural literacy, and broaden my horizons. In addition, some entertainment programs are very creative, which can help us diverge our thinking, stimulate our imagination and creativity.
