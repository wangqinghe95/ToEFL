## Do you agree or disagree	that holding different opinions	will hurt friendship?
+ 我不同意持有不同观点会伤害友情这一看法。
+ 首先，每个人的背景，文化，成长环境各不相同，所以每个人看问题的角度和方式也是不一样的。两个人对于一件事的持有不同观点是一个非常正常的事情，所以我们应该理解包容这种差异和不同。
+ 再次，朋友之间的不同观点可以增加对彼此的理解和接纳，使得友谊变得更加丰富和有意义。我们需要做的是如何通过良好的沟通来维护这段友谊。

+ I disagree with the view that holding different opinions will hurt friendship.
+ First, everyone's background, culture and growing environment are different, which leads to everyone having a different perspective and approach to issues. so it's very common for two people to hold different views on the same thing, we should appreciate and understand this difference.
+ Secondly, different views between friends can increase the understanding and acceptance of each other, which makes friendship more rich and meaningful. What we need to do is to maintain this friendship through good communication.

## Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? People should	not interrupt others when they are giving opinions.
+ 我同意这个观点。
+ 首先，打断别人说话本身就是一件很不礼貌的事情。这会让人感觉到他们的观点不被尊重或者不被重视，除非是在一些紧急的情况下或者需要纠正别的人错误的时候。尊重他人的发言是良好沟通的基础。
+ 再次，打断别人表达观点会影响沟通交流的效率。在和别人沟通的过程中，频繁地打断别人的发言，只会浪费所有人的时间和精力。所以为了高效地和别人交流，听完别人的发言再说话是一个非常有用的策略。

+ I agree with this view.
+ first of all, it is very impolite to interrupt others when they are giving opinions, which will make one feel that their views are not respected or valued, unless in some emergency or when correcting someone who is wrong. Respect for what others say is the foundation for good communication.
+ Secondly, interrupting others to express their opinions will affect the efficiency of the communication. In the process of talking with others, it will cost time and energy for all if one interrupts others frequently. Therefore in order to communicate effectively, it's a very useful strategy to speak after listening to others' words.

## Some	secondary school require that every student’s schedule include study hall, which is a free class period during the school day in which students can	do class assignments or rest. do you think this is a good idea? why or why not? use details and examples in your response.
+ 我认为这是一个好的主意。
+ 首先，在课堂上听老师教授知识是一个输入的过程，而做课堂作业是一个将学到的知识输出的过程，所以初中生需要一个合适的地方完成作业，以及休息，这对他们的学习都很重要。
+ 再次，不是所有的初中生在放学回去以后都能有一个安静的地方，甚至时间来完成老师在课堂上布置的作业，所以在学校很有必要安排一个空闲教室给学生完成他们的作业。

+ I think this is a good idea.
+ First, listening to teacher teach knowledge in class is process of input, while doing classroom homework is a process of outputing the knowledge learned. So middle school students need a suitable place to do their assignment and rest, which is important for their study.
+ Second, Not every student has a quiet place or enough time to finish their homework after school, so it is a necessary for schools to arrange a free classroom and time for students to allow them to do their class assignments.

## Some	university require students	to choose a	major when entering school while others	require students to study several fields at first and then choose a	major. Which do you prefer?
+ I argue that college students should study several fields at frist and then choose a major.
+ First, it is beneficial for college students. It can help students broaden horizons and knowledge base if studying several fields at first, as it can help students build a solid foundation of learning, as well as help them know the complexity and diversity of this world.
+ Second, college is the best time for students to study, as they have enough time and passion to explore this world, and studying more courses is the convenient and effective way to know this world.

+ 我主张大学生应该首先学习多个领域，然后再选择一个专业。
+ 首先，这对大学生有益。如果一开始就学习多个领域，可以帮助学生拓宽视野和知识基础，因为这可以帮助他们建立坚实的学习基础，同时让他们了解这个世界的复杂性和多样性。
+ 其次，大学期间是大学生学习的最佳时期，因为他们有足够的时间和热情去探索这个世界，而学习更多的课程是了解这个世界的便捷和有效的方式。

## Do you agree or disagree? Parents can know their children’s grades only when they get permission by their children?
+ I disagree with this view.
+ first, as the guardians of their children, parents have the right to understand the growth of their children, and also have the right to check the grades of their children. Parents can guide and supervise their children's learning only by knowing their children's academic performance.
+ Of course, this doesn't mean that parents can excessively intervene in their children's lives and studies. Parents need to grasp the boundaries of parent-child relationship, which can not only repsect children's independence but also help children grow up better.

+ 我不同意父母需要在得到他们孩子的许可下才能知道孩子的成绩这个观点。
+ 首先，父母作为孩子的监护人，有权利关心孩子的成长，也有权利查看孩子的成绩。只有了解孩子的学习成绩，父母才能更好的指导和督促孩子的学习。
+ 当然，这不意味着父母可以过度干预孩子的学习和生活，需要父母把握好亲子关系的界限，既能尊重孩子的独立性又能更好地帮助孩子地成长。

## Do you agree	or disagree with the following statement? Kids should be allowed to keep pets.
+ I agree with this view. 
+ First, there are many benefits for children in keeping pets, which can help them cultivate warmth of heart, patience and responsibility, can accompany their growth, and help them how to take care of and respect life, etc.
+ Second, there are some precondition to allow children to keep pets, for example, it needs good economic foundation, and there should be enough time and energy to look after pets. If the family condition allows, it is a good thing to keep a pet.

+ 我同意这个观点
+ 首先，养宠物对孩子有很多好处，可以帮助孩子培养爱心，耐心和责任感，可以陪伴孩子成长，帮助孩子学习如何照顾和尊重生命等等。
+ 但是允许孩子养宠物有一些前置条件，比如需要一定的经济基础，有足够的时间和精力来照顾宠物等等，如果在家庭条件满足的情况下，允许孩子养宠物是一个好事。

## A/D: We should be completely honest and open with friends 
+ I agree with this view.
+ Firstly, it's a necessary condition to be honest with friends. We can only gain true friendship from our friends if we are honest. So, it’s important to be honest with friends
+ Secondly, it’s also essential for friends to be open-minded. Open-mindedness is the ability to allow friends to hold different opinions. Because everyone’s background, culture, and beliefs are different, we need to find common ground and respect differences with our friends.

+ 我同意这个观点。
+ 首先，对朋友保持真诚是建立友谊的必要条件。只有真诚的与朋友交往，我们才能从朋友那里获得真正的友谊。所以很有必要与朋友保持真诚。
+ 再次，开放对于友谊也非常重要，开放指的是允许和朋友持有不同的观点，因为每个人的背景，文化，信仰不同，所以我们要和朋友们求同存异。

## Some people buy food that is already prepared. Other people buy fresh food and prepare meals themselves. Which do you prefer?
+ 我更喜欢买已经做好的食物。
+ 第一个原因是这可以帮助我节省很多时间，我可以做一下我感兴趣的有趣的事，比如游泳，骑行或者阅读。这些有益于我的身心健康。
+ 第二个原因是有很多种食物供我选择，如果我在外面吃，我认为这会比我自己做的食物更美味，因为它们都是由很多年厨艺经验的人做的。

+ I prefer buying food that is already prepared. 
+ The first reason is that it will help me save plenty of time so that I can do some interesting things I enjoy, such as swimming, riding and reading, which are beneficial for my mental and physical health.

##  Do you agree that celebrities are good examples for young people? 
+ 我不同意名人是年轻人很好的榜样这一观点。
+ 第一个原因是名人只是被很多人知道，但是名人并不一定由其他好的品质，比如正直，远见或者能力。
+ 第二个原因是我认为那些为社会和国家做过贡献的人才有资格成为年轻人好的榜样，比如科学家，优秀的老师，和伟大的政治家，因为他们做的事非常有意义，也值得年轻人学习。

+ I disagree with the view that celebrities are good examples for young people.
+ The first reason is that celebrities are just known to a lot of people, but celebrities don't necessarily have other good characteristics, such as integrity, vision or competence.
+ The second reason is that I think the people who contribute to the society and country qualified to be good examples for young children, such as scientists, excellent teachers, and great politicians, because what they do is very meaningful and worth learning for young children.

## Some people prefer to make a plan with their friends about social activities, while others prefer to decide about what to do when they meet their friends. Which do you prefer?
+ 我喜欢和我的朋友制定关于社会活动的计划。
+ 第一个原因是这可以节省所有参与者的时间，制定一个好的计划可以告诉所有人我们需要做什么， 什么时间什么地点去做。尽管所有的社会活动可能不会如计划那样进行，至少我们知道我们的目标是什么，我们应该做什么。
+ 第二个原因是如果我们提前做了计划，我们可以为社会活动提前准备些什么，比如携带一些必要的设备，穿上合适的衣服和鞋子。这样社会活动可能会更成功。

+ I would like to make a plan with my friends about social acitivities.
+ The first reason is that it can save time for all participants. Making a good plan can tell everyone what we need to do, when and where to do it. Although the social activities may not proceed exactly as planned, at least we know what our goal is and what we should do.
+ The second reason is that we can prepare something for social activities if we make a plan in advance, such as taking some necessary equipment, wearing proper clothes and shoes. That way the social activities would be even more successful.

## Do you agree that universities are successful because of experienced professors?
+ 我不同意大学因为有经验的教授而成功。
+ 第一个原因是我认为大学是一个教书的地方，所以大学的成功取决于是否能够培育优秀的大学生，他们有正直和能力。
+ 第二个原因是有很多因素影响培养有道德和能力的大学生，比如大学的校风，老师的品德。所以只有经验丰富的教授是不够的。

+ I disagree with the view that universities are successful because of experienced professors.
+ The first reason is that I think the university is a place for teaching, so the success of a univeristy depends on whether it is able to teach excellent college students who both have integrity and competence.
+ The second reason is that there are many factors that affect the cultivation of moral character and ability of college students, such as school spirit of the university and the quality of teachers. So it's not enough to only have experienced professors.

## Which is more important to the success of an artist: natural talent or hard work?
+ 我认为对一个艺术家的成功来说，天赋要比努力更重要。
+ 第一个原因是，天赋是一个人的上限，特别是对于一个艺术家。天赋高的人更有可能想出好的想法，或者从他生活中或者想象力中获得灵感，因此对于他们来说更容易创造出非凡的艺术品。
+ 第二个原因是天赋能够培养出创造力，这些对于艺术家想要成功非常重要，比如它们能够帮助他们在艺术领域达到更大的高度。

+ I think the natural talent is more important than hard work to the success of an artist.
+ The first reason is that natural talent sets the upper limit for a person, especially for an artist. People who are born with high talent are more likely to come up with good ideas, or draw inspiration from things in their life or imagination, Therefore it is easier for them to create extraordinary works of art.

## Do you agree that it is more important to maintain the relationship with family members than with friends? 
+ 我认为家庭成员和朋友同等重要
+ 首先，友谊和亲情对每个人都非常重要，我们能够从爱我们的家人获得无条件的支持，我们也能够和我们的好朋友玩耍，成长，开心。
+ 再次，友谊和亲情在我们的生活中互相补充。尽管我们的父母无条件地爱着我们，但是有些事他们不会理解因为成长的环境。好朋友能够互相帮助，但是极少好朋友陪伴对方一辈子。

+ I think family members and friends are equally important.
+ First of all, friendship and family love are essential for everyone, we can gain unconditional support from family members who love us, we can also play, grow up, and have fun with our good friends.
+ Secondly, friendship and family affection complement in our life. Although our parents love us unconditionally, but they can't understand something because of the different environment of growing up. Good friends can help each other, but fewer friends can accompany others for a life time.

## Some people tend to judge a person on the basis of the first observation,  while other people believe that it takes a long time to know a person well. Which do you think is better?
+ 我认为需要花很长时间去真正了解一个人。
+ 首先，第一眼判断一个人不可靠，第一眼获得的信息是有限的，你无法从外表分辨出很多事情，比如他们的过去，饮食习惯，爱好等等
+ 再次，分辨一个人的品质需要花费大量的实践，比如正直，言行一致。这些品质非常重要并且不能在短时间内观察出来，它们都需要在一个人特定的场景或者特定的条件才会显现。

+ I believe that it takes a long time to truly know a person.
+ First of all, it's not reliable to judge a person at first glance, the information you can get from a glance is very limited, you can't discern many things just from appearance, such as their past, hobbies, eating habits, and so on.
+ Secondly, it should take a considerable amount of time to tell one's characteristics, such as honesty, consistency in one's words and actions. These qualities can't be discovered in a short time. they all need to be displayed by a person on certain occasions or under certain conditions.

## Do you agree that students should be allowed to take additional courses to graduate as soon as possible?
+ 我不同意学生应该参加额外的课程才能毕业。
+ 首先，学校应该根据大学生的接受能力为他们安排适当的课程，因为一个人的时间和精力是有限的，参加太多的课程对学生没有任何好处。
+ 其次，社会活动对学生来说同样重要，因为社会活动可以帮助学生了解社会的复杂性和多样性，同时为他们的未来生活和职业生涯做好准备。
+ I disagree that students should take additional courses to graduate.

## Do you agree that it is beneficial for students to set aside some time for group discussions in class?

+ 一方面，大学生有足够多的时间和精力允许他们参加一些俱乐部活动，这可以帮助他们增长阅历，结交朋友，培养能力和爱好，还能为他们未来的职业和生活做准备。
+ 另一方面，学习一些其他课程和完成学校作业也非常重要，因为这可以帮助他们应对学术的要求和挑战，顺利地完成他们的学业。

+ 再次，强制退休不意味着他不能继续工作，如果一个人真的对工作很有热情或者不得不工作赚钱，他可以以返聘的方式继续工作。
