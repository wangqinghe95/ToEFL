## Judge a person by outward apperance
+ I don't think it is reliable to judge a person by the first glance. 
+ Firstly, apperance doesn't represent all, the infomation of a person you can get from a glance is very limited. you can't tell many things just from the apperance, such as the past, hobbies, eating habits and so on.
+ Furthmore, appearance lies, it may trick you. What you can get is partial, which even lead to prejudice. A person who dresess decently and talks sincerely  doesn't imlpy that he is definitely innocent and kind. You can't judge a book by its cover
+ So I support that one shouldn't judge a person just from the appearance.

## Study from self experience
+ I think it's more important to learn from personal experience, although advices from others are helpful and sometimes necessary.
+ First of all, when you have problems or get into dilemma, you are person the who's familiar with what really want and it'll promote you to develop the ability to solve problems. Advices from others may be just the opposite to your expectations. 
+ In addition, more personal experience will make one more mature and capable. You can have a better understanding of a society in a more comprehensive and objective way.
+ So I'd like to learn from personal experience.

## Live in the plain
+ I would like to perfer on the plain.
+ First, I like wide open view. Second, the plain usually has fertile soil on which I can grow food and feed animals. Also, If I have a car or some sort of transportation, I can easily go around to explore surrounding area.
+ Living in the forest is also wonderful, But I just don't like the moist climate there and mosquitoes. And desert is definitely a bad place to live, because I may not even have enough water to liveã€‚ Looking back at the history of our civilization, many cities and kingdoms were originally found on the plain area. 
+ Therefore, I believe the plain is also the most suitable for us to live among there.
